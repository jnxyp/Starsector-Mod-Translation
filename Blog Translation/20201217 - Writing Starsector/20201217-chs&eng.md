The next update will add strong narrative RPG elements to Starsector, among other things.

I feel no small amount of trepidation because this is both *a change* and it is *a particular story* about *particular characters* in a way the pure sandbox certainly isn’t. This necessarily constrains your – the player’s – experience of the game-fantasy and the meta-game fantasy of an “unfinished game” which has the potential to become everyone’s dreams in a free-floating quantum state… until you see it for real and it turns out it isn’t quite what you dreamed.

下次更新将会为游戏添加强烈的叙事性RPG元素，以及其它一些内容。

这一对游戏的*重大更改*让我深感焦虑，因为其中包含的针对*特定角色*的*特定故事内容*显然不属于纯沙盒游戏的范畴。在此之前，对于这种未完成游戏的内容和机制，玩家仍可以抱有量子叠加态般的幻想，幻想着游戏将会成为他们梦想中的样子……直到幻想被游戏的实际内容更新打破。

I suppose this seems like an awfully negative way to start off; this is what I mean about trepidation. And I am legitimately excited about sharing more of the world of Starsector, letting players dive in a bit closer and get a feel for what it’s like for people that live in this world. Find out what they think, find out a bit more about why movers and shakers move like they do. If I may say so, I think we’ve done some pretty good work!

我估计这是个挺消极的开场白，但这就是我焦虑的地方。从另一方面来说，我很乐意通过这些更新向各位展示远行星号的世界，并鼓励各位玩家去更深入地体会远星世界中芸芸众生的生活；了解人们的想法，并理解势力巨擎们的行事动机。如果让我来评价的话，我认为我们目前在这方面做的相当不错。

The written wordcount has already exceeded the minimum definition for a novel (50k) a few times over by now. I’ve attempted [Nanowrimo](https://nanowrimo.org/) a few times in the past and always choked almost instantly. My experience writing Starsector has been a stark contrast – the words just flow! It seems so obvious, most of the time, what comes next, what feels right to be said. I suspect part of it is the constraint of the medium focusing creativity, but it may also perhaps be the very clear connection to an audience (that’s y’all out there!). A novel feels a bit like a bunch of words floating out  in (ha) space. A game, however, has a player. They must actively engage and progress. I know a player is committed in a way a reader isn’t. (Which probably isn’t at all true; people read books, after all. [I’ve even read one or two in my day.](http://fractalsoftworks.com/2015/03/12/a-starsector-reading-list/))

远行星号中的文本量，已经达到了短篇小说最小篇幅（5万字）的好几倍。我曾好几次试着用 [Nanowrimo](https://nanowrimo.org/) （注：小说写作辅助网站）来写点别的，但基本上每次一开头就摸了，与我在创作远星游戏剧情时的文思泉涌形成了鲜明的对比。在我创作游戏剧情的大部分时候，后续的情节和适当的对白都会自然地浮现出来。我认为这种区别，有可能是因为创作媒介的限制而使创造力得以集中，但也有可能源于游戏剧本创作过程中和读者（也就是你们）的紧密联系。小说给人的感觉，仅是一堆漂浮在空间中的文字；而游戏，则有玩家的参与。由于玩家必须主动地去参与和推进游戏剧情，故玩家的投入程度是小说读者所没有的（也不一定全是这样，人们也会认真看书的，就连我也[看过几本](http://fractalsoftworks.com/2015/03/12/a-starsector-reading-list/))

Whatever it is, maybe I can’t rationalize it. But something works here for me in a way that hasn’t elsewhere. I’ll take it.

Let’s get to the nuts and bolts of this.

不管推动我创作的力量到底是什么，可能我也说不清，但我在创作中的确发现了些独特的游戏剧本写作技巧，我反正就先用上了。

接下来让我们看看这些技巧的细节。

We’ve had to deal with certain constraints and design problems while adding written content to Starsector. Some of these are faced by all games which use writing, some are particular to the context of Starsector. I am not going to talk about any specific narrative beats or plot details, but I will talk about how the narrative is structured, so from a certain point of view one could derive meta-spoilers from this blog post. I think the most pure and magical way to experience Starsector would be with no foreknowledge of any of this, so I’ll give you fair warning now: if you don’t want to know anything, stop reading.

在向远行星号添加剧情内容的同时，也必须考虑游戏设计带来的一些限制。有一些限制是所有游戏共有的，而有一些则是远星中独有的。在下文中我将避免提及具体的叙事内容和剧情细节，但我会讨论游戏叙事本身的设计；因此，从某些意义上来说，你仍然可以通过下文描述而脑补出部分具体设计，从而造成对游戏机制的剧透。我个人认为，体验远行星号最为纯净而梦幻的方式就是预先对其设计一无所知，所以，剧透警告：如果你不想知道叙事设计的内容，立刻停止阅读。

Scared ’em away? Good. Now, let me tell you all the secrets…

把他们吓跑了吧？奈斯。现在，请听我娓娓道来……

Let me use [a question asked by TheDTYP in the forum](http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=19524.0) as a starting point:

> … would anyone be able to comment on just how much agency the player has in these upcoming missions? Are they generally going to be straightforward like the Red Planet mission, in which you follow the breadcrumb trail and overcome the challenges for a reward while learning about the game world, or will they be more dynamic? As in, can certain elements of the mission or the outcomes be influenced by the players in some way? Like, “I stole this McGuffin, do I give it to the Hegemony or the League to turn in the mission?” kind of stuff?

让我引用官方论坛坛友 [TheDTYP 的提问](http://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=19524.0) 作为开头：

> …… 能讨论下玩家在未来任务中产生的影响吗？未来的任务是会像现在的“红色星球”任务一样比较直接，即让玩家追随一连串线索，解决一连串困难，并在获得回报的同时了解游戏世界，还是会更加富有戏剧性？能不能让任务的某些部分，以某种方式，受到玩家的影响而改变？例如，“我顺到了某关键任务物品，是找霸主还是英仙座交任务呢？”这样的东西？

There are a lot of questions to unpack here. I think I need to start with some groundwork.

Narrative player agency is of course an illusion. A successful game narrative creates the illusion of narrative agency through clever design, stagecraft, and the willingness of the player to believe our lies. Don’t get me wrong here: the illusion is real, and it works, and it’s good. It will also break down into its constituent parts, less than the sum of the whole you enjoyed so much, if you look too closely. I think the first few times one who possesses an inquiring mind sees through this in a media work, it’s immensely disappointing. Nowadays I find I can more consciously appreciate the illusion even if I see-what-you’re-doing-there.

这一提问中包含许多具体的问题值得讨论，我觉得我需要先铺垫一波。

在剧情叙事框架下的玩家“自由”选择当然是不存在的。但通过巧妙的构思，剧情设计，以及玩家本身对假象的容忍，一个成功的游戏能创造出逼真的**幻象**，让玩家在剧情框架下自由地做出选择，施加影响。不要误会了我的意思，这种幻象无疑是正面的，在游戏设计中确实存在，而且效果拔群。但如果你死抠细节，这幻想就会崩解为其背后的组成部分，而这些部分加起来也无法让你感受到幻想整体所带来的享受。我想，对于一个富有探究精神的人，当他前几次看穿作品营造的幻象时，一定是无比失望的。而我已经习惯了这一点，即使看穿了作者在背后的小动作，也能继续欣赏这一幻象。

Remember our spoiler warning: I am going to break some elements down into constituent parts and it will dispel the illusion if you’re not careful about managing your own experience. Let us find wisdom in these immortal words:

> What do I care for your suffering? Pain, even agony, is no more than information before the senses, data fed to the computer of the mind. The lesson is simple: you have received the information, now act on it. Take control of the input and you shall become master of the output.

> Chairman Sheng-ji Yang, “Essays on Mind and Matter”

Take control of the input. This is your second chance to get off the meta-spoiler train.

别忘了咱之前的剧透警告：我接下来就要解构幻象中的一些组成部分了，也就是说，如果你日后不能很好地控制你的想法，那么游戏中的幻象就会被打破。让我们从这不朽的圣言中汲取智慧：

> 我又何必在意您的痛苦呢？不论是何种疼痛，也不过是感官接收的信息，是输入名为“心灵”的电脑的数据而已。结论很简单：你接收到了信息，现在来处理它。控制你的输入，你将掌控你的输出。

> 仰生技主席，《论心灵与物质》

学会控制您的输入。这是您第二次下车以避免机制剧透的机会。

## Leaving Space & Not Answering Questions 留白 & 不要回答

iD software’s *Quake* got into my brain at an impressionable stage of my life. I must have been 12 or so, the perfect age for that sort of thing. That game provoked my interest in everything from HP Lovecraft to electronic/industrial/metal music. Did Quake have a good story? Absolutely not. Did it have a story? Barely. Worldbuilding? Uhh… (And going back and examining the development of *Quake*, it turns out it’s the product of a bunch of people who were tired after the whirlwind success of *Doom*, and in a great deal of conflict with one another about where to take the company. Romero left, iD lost its soul. That’s all another story, however.)

在那容易被震惊的年纪，我玩到了 iD software（注：美国游戏公司，作品：《毁灭战士》、《雷神之锤》，其《雷锤》的开源引擎被用于早期版的《反恐精英》） 所制作的《雷神之锤》。我那时候估计已经满12了，正是对这类东西上瘾的时候。这游戏启发了我一系列的爱好，从H·P·洛夫克拉夫特（注：小说家，克苏鲁神话体系创建者）到电子、工业和金属风音乐。那么，《雷神之锤》有不错的剧情吗？绝对没有。那它有剧情吗？勉强有。世界观呢？呃……（回过头来看《雷锤》，其实就是在《毁灭战士》梦幻般的成功后，疲惫的人们在公司发展上各执一词的产物。罗梅洛（注：id soft 游戏设计师）辞职，id soft 也失去了灵魂。不过，这都是另一个故事了。）

Quake was a collection of vaguely related aesthetic impressions thrown into a bucket and due to said development issues never given a strong overall authorial voice – but it had something due, probably, to inertia from *Doom* and a weird sense of “competing dungeonmasters” in the level design. I think it’s a better game for that weird mix. I think if had iD got itself organized enough to come up with a strongly directed narrative, it’d have been super dumb. It’d have broken the magic of Quake. (See: Quake 2. Fun enough game, dumb as rocks. Arguably same deal for Doom, but I think that game works for similar reasons to Quake, though the mechanics are tighter due to more cohesive teamwork.)

《雷神之锤》是一系列松散联系起来的美学印象的集合，并且因为前述原因，从头到尾也没有一个明确的创作旋律。另一个可能的原因，则是源于《毁灭战士》的设计惯性，以及“地牢领主PK”这一奇怪的关卡设计风气。基于这么一个奇怪的杂烩，《雷锤》作为游戏还算不错。如果 id soft 能有足够的组织度，给《雷锤》设计一个强烈的导向型叙事的话，那反而会显得很蠢，打破《雷锤》本身的魅力。（《雷锤2》就是这样，游戏海星，但是蠢得和石头一样。可以说《毁灭战士》也是如此，但是基于与《雷锤》类似的原因，还不错。因为在开发时团队更有凝聚力，所以游戏机制也更加紧凑）

Anyway, what really got 12-year-old me was looking out into those blocked-off parts of the maps where you heard that howling wind and watched as layers of purple clouds flowed over each other. What kind of world was out there? I wondered. Surely something bizarre; scifi gothic horror beyond imagination populated by the best kind of monsters: the kind you never see. What was most interesting about *Quake* was what wasn’t there; what was suggested. The greatest horror movies never totally answer what, why, and how. The answer will always be disappointing; the shadowy gaps are where fear lives! Embrace it!

总之在《雷锤》中，真正让12岁的我感到兴奋的是，看向那些在地图上进不去的地方，你能听到那呼啸的风声，看着层层叠叠的紫色云朵互相流动。外面的世界是什么样的呢？我在想。肯定是一些奇异的东西；超乎想象的科幻哥特式恐怖世界，里面住着最吊的怪物：那种你从未见过的怪物。《雷锤》最有趣的地方在于游戏中不存在的东西；即它所暗示的东西。最伟大的恐怖电影从来不会完全给出有什么，为什么和要怎么样之类问题的答案。答案永远是令人失望的；阴暗的缝隙才是恐惧的所在！拥抱未知！

It’s not just horror. If I tried to explain the scifi principles behind everything in Starsector, a thousand intense physics nerds would tear me apart with their fascinating equations and they’d be right and I’d be wrong. There are questions in Starsector that I shouldn’t answer, and Ludd willing, I won’t!

This is part of the *illusion*. If the game evokes rather than answers, then the illusion takes hold in the player’s mind. Like we offload 3d rendering into a specialized piece of hardware, it’s like I’m offloading rendering of the narrative into your brain.

这种留白不仅仅是为了营造恐怖气氛。如果我尝试去解释远星中一切事物背后的科幻原理，那么999个物理学带师会用天花乱坠的公式把我大卸八块，并证明他们是对的而我是错的。远星中有一些问题，我不应该回答。向路德之神保证，我绝对不会去回答的！

这种留白也是之前提到**幻象**的一部分。如果游戏不是去回答问题，而是去启发玩家，那么所营造的幻象才能在玩家脑海中占据一席之地。就像我们把3D渲染结果载入到专门的硬件里一样；就像我把游戏叙事的渲染结果载入到你的脑子里一样。

Of course no one wants to read a story where every fact is hedged with a dramatic “but maaaaayybe it’s this! Or that! Or even over there! Or nothing at all.” \*waves hands wildly\*

Yeah, that’s insufferable.

## Appealing To Players Without Disappearing Up One’s Own Jump-point

It serves a narrative well to exercise restraint. The worst thing I can see when loading up a new RPG is a huge infodump about the world and what’s going on and who I’m supposed to be and the ten thousand year history of the kingdom of whatever and hey, guess what Artemisia Sun’s favorite food is! I’m going to tell you! But I don’t care – yet. I appreciate that the author is excited about showing off their work to their audience, but that care has to be earned. Start a game by framing a player’s experience of the game-fantasy with a simple archetype. Starsector has it easy: this is a space opera, you’re Han Solo[1]. Figure it out. When you’re ready to start asking questions, the answers will be in the game.

I’ve gotten into playing D&D this past Year of the Plague – and more than playing, I’m also running a game. (Big surprise; right.) It’s helped me think a lot about what I find myself doing to make the game relatable to players. These are my friends, I know them, and I can come up with something I think they will find compelling. If they grab onto that hook, I go further with it and riff with them and see how their choices change the world.

I can’t exactly do that with Starsector, as much fun as it’d be to run that tabletop RPG. Computer games are a different beast. But I think some of the principles can apply, you just have to apply them more broadly.

![][pic-hax]

What Alex and I try to do – and not just in narrative terms – is try to anticipate generalized player archetypes. Some people like exploring, some like building, some love fighting, some like intrigue and “lore”[2], some people are named Megas and want to optimize everything. We try to imagine how each of these archetypes would react to situations we set up: uh oh, those Pathers are at it again! How can I respond? Just go down the list: fighting archetype blows them away, intrigue tries to talk them out of it, maybe someone pays them off, maybe someone else gets someone else to fight for them, the lore bore tries to wheedle some backstory out of it somehow…

This applies to more than just fleet encounters of course. If we send the player into dialog with a character and the topic of Big Things In The Sector comes up, I try to anticipate how different types of players will react, then allow them to take a stance on the issue. Say we’re messing with Domain-era artifacts, how do you respond? It doesn’t have to be tremendously complex – and it doesn’t have to be so simple as a good vs. boring vs. evil choice. Building toward archetypes let’s us focus the range of possibilities toward something manageable in the face of a potentially exponentially exploding number of possibility states.

To back up to a higher level, it is important to say here that the narrative is not solely driven by what [I think] players’ want. Media created purely and cynically in-anticipation-of or in-reaction-to viewer feedback is generally… bad (and is absolutely a certain level of Hell for any creative person).

So yes, I am telling a story with my own voice, my own weird ideas and interests[3]. But we are also making a conscious effort to [make the story inviting to the players we anticipate will show up to experience it](http://marriedtothesea.com/index.php?search=shakespeare+got+to+get+paid).

What’s this look like in the game, then.

## Long-form Narrative Mission Arcs

We have missions. You’ve scanned some derelicts, surveyed some planets. Did you find the red planet? Nice! That was one of our first test-cases to see if the mechanics of campaign-level missions could work and if they’d be appealing to players.

Answered: yes, and yes. Thank you for being good test subjects.

Imagine a series of missions like those, all strung together. Let’s say we introduce recurring characters. There are random elements so you don’t quite know what to expect every time. There are different approaches possible; maybe you fight, maybe you talk, maybe you bribe, maybe you find some other way to deal with a situation. There are choices to make: some change your outlook immediately. Some don’t matter. Some don’t seem to matter until they come up again way later, and you’ll be like “Alex and David, I see what you guys did there.”

You can lie, you can con, you can betray. Maybe you’ll keep getting away with it. Maybe not.

We’re getting somewhere! It’s pretty cool, I think. And I don’t have a lot more to say about all of that than, yes, we did stuff and I can’t wait to see how people play through it.

Now let’s temper some expectations: Factions will come into play, the player will interact with prominent figures from most of the factions, but we’re not making players swear loyalty to them as part of the primary storyline. That said, having a commission or extreme reputation with a faction one way or another will impact certain situations.

Also: there will not be an ending to the game in this update.

(Not yet. But you will “determine the fate of the Sector by your actions” before this game is finished, that much is certain.)

Having the experience of implementing a series of large narrative arcs, once we see how this all plays out, we’ll be in a very good place to see where we want it to end up. And we’ll know how to get it there.

Having addressed that big picture question, let’s dive back down into some more details.

![][pic-squad2]

## Dialog Mechanics 对话机制

We’re building Starsector’s narrative largely on text. What can I say, the medium is cheap! So I hope y’all like reading, because there’s going to be a bit of that involved. (I shall also try to be considerate of people who hate reading, mind you. That’s definitely one of the anticipated player archetypes.)

So unless the text is purely info-dumping, there’s got to be an interactive component. Make a choice, get some different results. Make different choices available based on previous choices, or based on other conditions that can be drawn from other mechanical attributes within the game (fleet strength, credits held, location, faction relations, person relations, arbitrary variables set elsewhere).

What about player skills, you ask. Welllllll…  Disco Elysium brilliantly inserts RPG dice-roll mechanics into dialog, and better than skill checks (though it does those), they are so often tests of the player’s character. And rightly so, because that’s a game that’s ostensibly about solving a mystery but really an exploration of a particular character’s psyche.

Starsector isn’t quite that. Starsector must function as a game, yes, but is must function as the game it already is, which is space fleet combat-focused. So while we discussed the idea of doing skill checks in-dialog, ultimately decided that this would expand the range of mechanics without meaningfully enhancing the game experience. Imagine our design process: the player experiences a challenge via dialog. Which of the 40 different skills will solve it? How many different options do we, as developers, need to provide so that it doesn’t feel extraordinarily limiting? Does this align at all with the player archetypes we’re anticipating? What if we end up using Weapon Drills twenty times but Auxiliary Support only once in dialog challenges? The player has no way of knowing that they chose a skill useless to dialog back at level 3. (We also thought through using the sum of skills chosen in a category or aptitudes as a basis for character type. It seems compelling at first because it allows for neat categorization, but once you parse through the implications it doesn’t actually make the game more interesting.)

When you’re running a D&D game you can just make up skill checks that “happen” to align with skills you know the players have. We have no such luxury.

Yes, en masse insertion of skills into dialog could theoretically be balanced and made to work, but that’s a lot of work (and it’s absolutely not responsible to try to shove an additional huge axis of mechanics into finely tuned interdependent game systems at this stage in development). Disco Elysium made it work with a huge number of skills because that’s literally what the game is about. Here, we’d just be adding absurdly intricate icing on top of the cake. Then the icing would fall over and look terrible, probably.

Take a step back. [Restate our assumptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k02KIOUU8Hw). Dialog option restrictions per skill would lock out most options for most players most of the time for most of the game. The player-experience return on developer time invested would be terrible. Besides, what do dialog option skill restrictions provide that doesn’t already exist?

How about instead we assume the player’s space captain is a generally competent person. Then instead of locking out options based on skill restrictions, let us take a positive route and allow the player choose the way in which they excel at the time of the choice as it comes up naturally in the dialog. Let the player lie and send a fake cryopod to the mercenary demanding they hand over the VIP, giving the player enough time to make their escape – AND take a finders fee of 20k credits from the merc. If that’s who the player wants their player to be, that is.

We even have a system for this already: [Story Points](http://fractalsoftworks.com/2019/07/08/skills-and-story-points/).

Conclusion: we don’t as a rule do skill checks in dialog – there’s an exception, but it’s largely for flavor – instead we use story points to let players choose when and how to be a totally awesome hero of their own story.

Speaking of that-

## The Player Character’s Character 玩家角色的性格

How do you possibly give players a reasonable range of choice without writing tens of options, and then allowing the compounding implications of those options to expand into hundreds, thousands of possible narrative cases?

Some games define a character for the player that’s a particular person who has their own opinions and outlook. Most games define at least a character who’s a bit of a cipher, allowing them to center their game mechanics. Master Chief or Gordon Freeman are pretty straightforward; they raise few questions about player agency outside of the limited mechanical range that the game can excel at. These are useful constraints.

We’re in a similar place with Starsector. This game has a nature to it, and it suggest a certain type of character: you’re some kind of cool space captain. Imagine a more successful Han Solo (which I guess makes you Lando, haha). I can safely assume that this character won’t have strong opinions or interest in something like farming except insofar as they’re buying, selling, or stealing cargo related to it. Good.

Still, we’ve got to keep dialog a bit vague. We have to leave an openness in interpretation of actual tone and wording so that the player can project enough of their own interpretation to those words that it feels correct. If we provide a dialog option that feels out of place or that pans out vastly contrary to the player’s expectation, then we lose narrative verisimilitude. The illusion wavers!

At the same time, it’s very important to give the player the opportunity to drop cool lines; there’s a time and place for specificity. The art of it is judging where to apply that and where to back off.

## On Secret Worldbuilding

There are big conflicts and mysteries in the world of Starsector. If you’ve played the game, you know what they are and you probably have some theories. You can infer that the story has to have something to do with them because we’ve put so much effort into setting them up; it’d be absurd to throw that work away. And it’d be cheap to pull a shock turnaround that contradicts everything already established. There’s a light cone, and the range of possible endings falls somewhere within it.

The worst thing we could do is explain everything. The second worst, explain nothing. My goal with the writing of Starsector is to evoke something greater than the sum of its parts, and part of doing that successfully is knowing when to shut up.

I’ll be doing that now. Enjoy the next update!

[1]: Please don’t sue us, Disney.

[2]: I kinda hate the word and concept of “lore” as applied to videogames, though I’ll use it. It feels like a failure somehow if “lore” is a strongly separated concept from the media work itself. This probably has structural roots in media works being consciously acted upon nowadays as intellectual properties that must have profitable derivative works spun off, and… save this rant for another day. (And I say all of this as someone who played Brigador and spent all my money on lore unlocks before anything else, so don’t take me too seriously.)

[3]: Alex has been very supportive of running with my weird ideas, and very kind in how he tells me when they go too far. The creative freedom he’s given me is spectacular, and I want thank him for it. Thanks Alex!
