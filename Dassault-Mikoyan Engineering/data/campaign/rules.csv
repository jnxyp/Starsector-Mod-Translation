Small kiosks around the ring sell flash-fried fish- and squidlike creatures, native to Odessa but tank-grown on station, with an assortment of spicy-sweet sauces. You wonder, as you suck the last greasy traces off your fingers, what the aboriginal cetaceans would make of this canned overview of their existence.

All in all, though, not a bad way to spend some time and a few spare credits, you think as you return to your ship.",istl_researchLeave:Leave,Visit Dialogue
