Balance:
- Reduced Rafale II OP cost to 20.
- Borzoi PPT reduced to 180.

Campaign:

0.9.8e - Content, balance adjustments. Will bork saves. Please consume space kitten mlems responsibly.

Content:
- Spirale: reduced speed, increased refit time from 10 to 12. New sprite.
- Borzoi: total rework, now a phase ship. Built-in Tomino AMM System.
- Added Rafale II Heavy Bomber, a 24-OP wing deploying Hedgehog cluster bombs.

Balance:
- Adjusted AMM family of weapons; AMM Blister MIRV reduced to 12 submunitions (from 16), fire interval set to 6 (from 4). Itano AMM health reduced to 35, fighter AMM reload time reduced to 0.15 from 0.2.
- Omni Blaster now fires a tight cluster of three shots rather than a double-tap burst; should be easier to land hits with.
- Quad Hybrid Blaster DPS reduced to 640.
- Tweaked Perforator acceleration and top speed downwards - should hit a little less often.
	• Damselfly: health/armor reduced to 500/90, more in line with the Khopesh. Reduced rocket volley to 7/pod. Removed flares.
- Flak Projectors reworked as Canister Flak; now fire a spread of buckshot.
- Autolaser family reworked as charge-based Capacitor Autolasers. More interesting this way.
	• Aigrette: removed flares, reduced Compact Autolaser charges to 12 to match the rest of the Autolaser family.
- Jeanne d'Arc flux dissipation/capacity reduced to 640/14000, hull points reduced to 12000, ATC removed, forward medium missile upgraded to large. Costs reduced to 55/55.
	• Target Datalink bonus reduced to 25%, uptime/downtime increased to 15/7.5
- Zelenograd dissipation reduced from 960 to 840, flux capacity increased to 16500. Should be a bit less of a beast.
- Added Delicate Machinery to Snow Goose.
- Replaced Hellrider Rafale I with Hedgehog proximity bomb version. It's a nice weird sidegrade, rather than a problem.
- Hit a bunch of stuff with minor nerfs and a very few buffs (ammo counts, +/- 50 range, etc).
- Changed Monobloc Construction's range penalty; instead of a flat 15% cut to ballistics, it reduces all weapon range by 50% above 600 units. Same net effect, generally cleaner implementation with fewer edge cases.

Campaign:
- Moved Yod system to avoid conflict with Metelson's Rock system.
- Made some minor system changes, expanded a few descriptions.
- Fixed solar mirrors orbiting Tenacity (connected to market, will now change allegiance with the planet when captured).

- Improved SFX of Raker and Ripper.

0.9.8b - More little stuff, some not-so-little stuff. May break saves.
- Cut down per-burst smart flare counts to 3 for ship, 1 for fighter versions. Mostly a visual thing, but makes fighter flares less potent.
- Added Defense Screen, a Damper Field clone that (hopefully) fixes some of the more egregious issues with the vanilla system. Used on Zelenograd and Kobra Mk. 3.
- Added Ramming Mode system for Baikal (Brone). Slower, but allows steering, and uses charges.
- Custom sigma nebula texture for relevant systems.
- Reduced Frappeur torpedo damage to 1350.
- Redid Quad Hybrid Blaster a bit - now does 800 DPS in four-round bursts of 400-dmg projectiles, no more charges.

- Included updated faction config for Nexerelin 0.8.3c.
- Integrated mod faction relations.
- Integrated mod faction relations into deserter start.

- More visual improvements to ships, weapons. New Perforator sprite. Adjusted turret locations, artwork of all Multi-PD Node carrying ships: should look nicer, positioning is improved. Damselfly got a once-over, fresh carrier deck designs.
- Reduced Lycosid Interceptor wing size to 5.
- Increased extra supply cost of Sixth Bureau hullmod to 15%.
- Increased fire rate of Heavy Linear Cannon; DPS increased slightly to 480, reduced damage per-shot to 160/50.

- Fixed Version Checker support.

0.9.6 - The slog forward continues. Will break your saves.
- First pass on Blade Breaker ships (not available in campaign, not remotely final).

- Set hullmod blocker up - Monobloc Construction now blocks Resistant Flux Conduits, Skipspace Reaction Furnace now blocks Resistant Flux Conduits and Safety Overrides. Should make for more of a challenge.

0.9.3 - Balance, minor content.
