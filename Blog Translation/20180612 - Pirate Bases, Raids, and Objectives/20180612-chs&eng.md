A primary gameplay role of player-built colonies is getting the player into trouble. Generally speaking, this trouble should be resolved through combat, since combat with context and real stakes is fun. And, after all, what would be the point of building a battlestation if your colonies never got attacked?

玩家建立的殖民地在游戏中的主要作用之一，就是给玩家带来麻烦。通常来说，这些麻烦应当通过战斗来解决，因为这种事出有因并且关系到（玩家）切身利益的战斗十分有趣。毕竟，如果你的殖民地从来不会受到攻击，那又为什么要建造一个战斗空间站呢？

One natural source for this kind of trouble is, of course, pirates.

而这种麻烦的天然来源之一，当然就是海盗。

(I do want to say that some of the details here are up in the air – I’ve made good progress on making it all work so far, enough to feel pretty comfortable talking about it, but some stuff will undoubtedly change. Right, disclaimer done; moving on.)

（我必须事先说明，这里展示的某些细节还未彻底确定下来 - 虽然我已经在这些内容的具体运作上取得了长足的进展，并且已经达到了一个令人满意的程度，但其中的某些东西无疑仍会改变。免责声明到此为止，我们继续。）

## Pirate Bases 海盗基地

There are a few pirate bases scattered throughout the Sector – outside the populated core systems, but generally close to it, for easier access. The player is unaware of these until they actually discover them.

在星域中人口密集的核心星系外，分布着几个海盗基地。这些基地通常距离核心星系不远，以便于海盗的来往。玩家在发现这些基地之前，并不知道它们的存在。

A pirate base periodically picks a nearby populated star system to target. All colonies in that system get a “pirate activity” market condition, reducing their accessibility and – at higher levels of pirate base development – stability.

一个海盗基地会周期性地选择一个邻近的星系作为目标，而当被选定为目标后，星系中所有的殖民地都会得到一个“海盗活动”市场debuff，从而降低它们的可到达性，并在海盗基地发展到一定级别时，降低市场的稳定性。

This may cause one of the affected factions to post a bounty for the destruction of the base; once that happens, the player is informed of the existence and location of the base, much like for other bounties. Destroying the base removes the “pirate activity” condition.

这种海盗活动可能会导致当地其中一个受影响的势力发布摧毁海盗基地的悬赏；一旦发生这种情况，玩家将会被告知海盗基地的存在和具体位置，就像其它的悬赏一样。摧毁海盗基地可以移除（殖民地的）“海盗活动”市场debuff。

## Pirate Base Defenses 海盗基地防御

Pirate bases have several tiers (currently, 5). The lowest tier is not combat-capable, while higher tiers feature an orbital station with an increasing number of combat modules. For example, a tier 2 station has one combat module (of the typical two or three on a regular orbital station), making it fairly weak, but also a good introduction to the basics of vs-station combat for the player. A higher-tier base is a significant challenge, being a fully-functional orbital station.

海盗基地有不同的级别（目前有五种）。最低等级（的基地）不具备作战能力，而更高等级的空间站拥有越来越多的作战（船体）模块。例如，一个二级的空间站拥有一个作战模块（常规的轨道站拥有两到三个），使其显得相当脆弱，但同时也不失为一个给玩家的对空间站战斗入门。更高等级的空间站将会是（游戏的）一个重要的挑战，将会是一个功能齐全的轨道空间站。

The base is also defended by a number of fleets, the number and quality of which depend on the tier of the base.

海盗基地也有一些防御舰队，其数量和质量取决于空间站的级别。

To recap, taking out a pirate base involves 1) finding it, and 2) defeating the station and its attendant fleets. But, it’d be nice if there were different strategic approaches, aside from “bring enough stuff, go in guns blazing, and maul it”. I’m also a fan of sneaking around with a smaller fleet, so something that can encourage that would be ideal.

概括一下的话，击破一个海盗空间站主要包括以下步骤：
1）找到它，并且 2）击败空间站以及其附属舰队。但是，如果存在除了“带上足够的家伙什，疯狂射爆并摧毁它”之外的不同战术方法，我将会很乐于接受。作为一个小舰队偷摸潜行爱好者，一些类似的策略无疑是很不错的。

## Objectives 太空设施

A clear and simple way to make the station weaker is to fight it alone, without support from nearby pirate fleets. Thus: pirate fleets need to have a reason to be elsewhere in the system, instead of being glued to the base they’re defending.

一个简单明了的削弱空间站势力的方法就是单挑，避开空间站防御舰队的支援。为了让海盗舰队不一直黏在它们所防御的空间站上，必须有某些调虎离山到星系其他地方的理由。

To accomplish this, we can build on what’s already in the game – comm relays. Currently, their only function is giving the player access to intel, but conceptually, they’re an important piece of infrastructure that factions will strive to control. From there, it’s a short step to a broader concept of  “objectives” that provide direct bonuses to the controlling faction’s fleets and colonies. The full set includes comm relays, sensor arrays, and nav buoys.

为了实现这一点，我们可可以利用游戏中已有的东西——通讯中继站。目前，中继站的唯一功能就是允许玩家访问`网络信息`，但从其概念上来讲，通讯中继站应当是各势力努力控制的重要基础设施的一部分。由此，可以很容易地引申出更宽泛的“太空设施”的概念：为控制方殖民地和舰队提供直接加成的设施。全套的设施包括通讯中继器、传感器阵列和导航浮标。

But, you say, comm relays are Domain-era technology, and not something that can be built using the current tech available in the Sector! And to make the gameplay work out, we’d really need to be able to build these – not every system that a pirate base is going to end up in is going to have ready-made Domain-era objectives sitting around, so the pirates would have to build them.

但你也许会质疑，通讯中继站依赖于Domain时代的科技，并不能用星区中现有的科技来建造！但为了让这个游戏机制正常运作，我们必须要能建造这些东西——并不是每一个海盗基地所在的星系都有现成的Domain时代的空间实体，所以海盗们必须亲自建造这些东西。

Enter the concept of “makeshift” objectives – a pale imitation of the original Domain version, but functional enough to grant a reduced bonus. So, you either find existing Domain-era ones (which is great! it makes the system highly desirable since it’s a bonus you can’t get just anywhere), or you make your own, which aren’t as good. And, of course, so do the pirates.

引入新的概念：“凑合”的空间实体（临时空间实体）——一种对于Domain原版设施的拙劣仿制，但仍能提供削弱过的加成。所以，你要么能够找到现成的Domain时代的东西（美滋滋！整个星系都将会因为这别无所得的加成而变得称心如意），要么自己建造一个，但就是差点事。对于海盗们来说也是如此。

But, you say, why not just build them next to the base, and have everything be defended at the same time? The tech involved only functions at a local minimum in the system’s hyperwave field, you see. These local minima are called “stable locations” and there is usually one to three of these in a star system, though a few luckless systems don’t have any. (Note: this is another parameter that affects the desirability of a system, as far as colonization goes. These mechanics very much do double duty, contributing both to exploration and to this specific instance of making pirate bases more interesting to deal with.)

但是你也许又会说了，为啥不直接把这些设施建在基地旁边来保证所有东西同时得到保护呢？（这是因为）这其中使用到的技术只有在星系中“超波场”的局部最弱点才能发挥作用，而这种局部弱点被称为“稳定点”。一个星系通常拥有一到三个这样的点，但非洲星系可能一个也没有。（注：对于殖民来说，这是影响星系适居性的的另一个参数。这些机制通常具有双重的作用，既鼓励（玩家）进行探索，又增强了打击海盗基地的趣味性。）

So, what do these do?

所以，这些是干啥的？

## Comm Relay

A comm relay provides intel access, as usual, regardless of which faction controls it. In addition, it provides a stability bonus to same-faction colonies in system – or, rather, it mitigates a stability penalty for *not* having a comm relay. The Domain-era version eliminates the penalty entirely; the makeshift one reduces it.

The player can install a comm sniffer at a relay, which makes intel access work as if the player was in-system – i.e., if you (say) install a sniffer at a comm relay in Askonia, you’ll find out about local missions even if you’re not in the system.

Having more than a couple of sniffers at various relays creates a chance that some will be found and eliminated by … the comm network’s maintenance protocols, let’s say. This means that 1) the player won’t get completely overwhelmed by incoming intel from installing these everywhere, and 2) where to install these is actually a choice, rather than “install everywhere and then regret it” being the optimal behavior.

A comm sniffer is not useful for dealing with pirates, and, in fact, a comm relay is not very useful to pirates. To reflect this, pirates will prefer to build the other objective types first, and will usually only build a relay in a 3-stable-location system.

## Nav Buoy

Increases the maximum burn level of same-faction fleets in system. Once again, smaller bonus for makeshift.

## Sensor Array

You’ve probably guessed it – it increases the sensor range of in-system fleets belonging to the same faction, with a smaller bonus for the makeshift version.

## Interactions

Alright, but what do these actually do, as far as giving the player a range of options for dealing with a pirate base? First off, the bonuses are significant enough that if left alone, it’ll make it hard to get a favorable engagement – the enemy fleets will most likely both be faster and see the player first. An overwhelming fleet can still do the job, though, since the pirate base isn’t exactly going to run away.

![][base_map]

The objectives will occasionally be guarded by pirate lookouts, giving the player a chance to engage a smaller pirate force. If these are defeated, or if the player sneaks to an objective, they’ll have several options.

One, they can take control of the objective. This gives the player the objective’s bonus, and elicits a military response from the pirates, who will most likely send a sizeable force to investigate.

Two, they can destroy the objective, getting some salvage in return, and eliciting the same sort of military response.

And, finally, they can hack the objective, temporarily gaining the bonus from it – without taking it away from the pirates, and without provoking a response. This is a more stealth, “even the playing field” option.

## Raids

You’re probably wondering, “but what does this have to do with player colonies and/or their defenses?” One part of it is that pirates will periodically establish bases near player colonies – being away from the core worlds, they’re more vulnerable – and the bases will need to be dealt with. (I’m still working through the details of how that’ll work; naturally a higher level of development will attract more piracy, but I haven’t nailed down the specifics quite yet.)

The other part is that pirate bases will occasionally launch raids. A raid takes some time to organize – depending on its strength, many fleets need to assemble in the same location first, before traveling to the target system. The player should generally find out about it ahead of time, so that there’s time to prepare a response.

A successful raid will reduce the colony’s stability for some time, though there may also be some more dire consequences in specific circumstances.

![][raid_aftermath]

A raid can be disrupted with a spoiling attack while it’s still assembling, or handled once it reaches the system it’s targeting.  The latter can involve a defensive battle, where the player fights on the same side as their orbital stations and patrols. Strong-enough system defenses can also handle smaller raids without the player having to be involved. Presumably, the strength of the raid would be communicated to the player, so they know whether it’s something they have to deal with personally or not. Again, this is a bit where I’m still working through some details, and pirate bases and raids would ideally be one of several sources of trouble, and not the only one.
