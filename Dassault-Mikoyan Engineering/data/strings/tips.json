"[DME] Ships with built-in missile weapons benefit from setting their fire groups to LINKED. Voltigeur ASMs are especially effective in simultaneous launches.",
"[DME] Dassault-Mikoyan weapons tend to be more specialized than their vanilla equivalents. In return, some of them have higher per-shot damage, shot speed, or flux efficiency.",
"[DME] All mainline Dassault-Mikoyan ships have high EMP resistance and quick overload recovery thanks to their built-in hullmod, Monobloc Construction.",
"[DME] Systems with Sigma Worlds usually have generous salvage or other hidden goodies. If you're not sure where to start exploring, head for the green stars.",
"[DME] Blade Breaker weapons have impressive stats, but suffer from inflated OP costs and poor flux efficiency. Mix them with vanilla or mainline DME weaponry for best effect.",
"[DME] Dassault-Mikoyan markets have lower tariffs than vanilla or other mod factions.",
"[DME] Dassault-Mikoyan plays well when allied to a slow, tanky faction like the Hegemony; their own ships focus on cruiser- and fighter-centric maneuver warfare.",
"Don't forget to hydrate! Drink water regularly while playing.",
"Space Nazis: better off dead, or at least, removed from your mod folder.",
