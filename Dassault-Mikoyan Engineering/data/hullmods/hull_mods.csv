Monobloc Construction,istl_monobloc,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.MonoblocConstruction,"This ship has been built using the latest proprietary techniques in systems integration, boosting EMP resistance by %s percent, and reducing overload time by %s percent. Interference from the high-output engines cuts into weapon range by %s percent above %s/%s/%s/%s units, depending on hull size.

Incompatible with Heavy Armor, which cannot be bonded to DME standard ceramic laminate.","Improves EMP resistance, dissipation speed, and vent speed, reduces overload duration and weapon range above 600/700/800/900 units. Blocks Resistant Flux Conduits.",graphics/ISTL/hullmods/istl_monobloc.png
Skipspace Reaction Furnace,istl_reactionfurnace,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.SkipspaceReactionFurnace,"This advanced ship has an integral skipspace reaction furnace, boosting EMP resistance by %s percent, increasing the flux vent rate by %s percent, and siphoning off excess energy bleed, resulting in a sensor profile reduction of %s percent.

Incompatible with Resistant Flux Conduits, and, because the reactor is so volatile and tightly integrated, it precludes the use of Safety Overrides.","Improves EMP resistance, vent speed, and sensor stealth. Blocks Safety Overrides and Resistant Flux Conduits. Engines take more damage in combat.",graphics/ISTL/hullmods/istl_reactionfurnace.png
