### Campaign

- Added portside bar to colonies
	- And a number of possible bar events of varying importance

- Added REDACTED mission (starts in bar)

- Added raids, bombardments, and planetary defenses
	- Can raid a colony for valuables, commodities, blueprints, and other items
	- Can raid to disrupt operations of a specific industry
	- Marines, specialized ships, and skills determine raid strength and outcome
	- Raids with transponder off do not cause instant hostility
	- Can bombard colonies using fuel; not very efficient
		- Tactical bombardment to disrupt military operations
		- Saturation bombardment: an atrocity; causes multiple factions to go hostile
			- Colonies of size 4 and below are destroyed outright
			- Larger colonies lose a lot of stability and are likely to decivilize after some time
	- Colonies can build up various layers of defenses
	- Nearby fleets prevent raids and bombardments
	- Orbital stations prevent bombardments but not raids
	- Ground defenses make raids more difficult and bombardments more expensive

- Can run salvaging operations on colonies with ruins
	- Must be surveyed first (for the ruins to be identified)
	- Outcome depends on scale of ruins on the planet

- Colonies that have low stability for too long have a chance to become decivilized

- Can view colony info and interact with core UI when docked with a hostile colony that does not give docking clearance

- Added monthly salary for marines

- Added REDACTED (to do with population growth)

- Officer level-up dialog keeps going while there are skill choices to make, unless "not now" is selected
	- Added shortcut key for "level up" button in dialog

- Orbiting fleets will no longer use Active Sensor Burst
	- Goal is to reduce randomness involved in successfully sneaking into a colony

- Added periodic warning message when fleet is over capacity in cargo/fuel/crew

- Added a recoverable Dram tanker to the ships around Tetra

- Changed "Hand Weapons" commodity to "Heavy Armaments"; now covers things like heavy weapons, tanks, mechs, hovercraft, etc

- Added pirate bases and raids

- Added Luddic Path cells

- Added Hegemony inspection

- Added punitive expeditions

- Added Synchrotron Core; can be installed in Fuel Production industry to drastically increase output

- Added blueprint and special item drops to various salvage

- Implemented Tech-Mining industry
	- Chance to find blueprints, modspecs and other rare items, based on the size of ruins being mined
	- Generates some basic commodities (fuel, supplies, metals, machinery); delivered to gathering point
	- Output goes down over time

- Updated various tooltips (added "design type" information - low tech, midline, etc where appropriate; made other improvements)
	- Cargo/commodities
	- Ship weapons
	- Ships
	- Hull mods
	- Various blueprints

- A colony sold a Synchrotron Core or a Nanoforge will use them if able to

- Tooltip for fleet points bar in ship deployment dialog now includes battle size and how many points the enemy has

- Jump-point dialog now includes a warning if there are nearby fleets on the other side
	- Includes warning and plays a sound if the nearby fleets are hostile

- New game start:
	- Added easier options that start you off with multi-ship fleets - a "salvage expedition" and a "mercenary force"
	- Added 3-year-long monthly stipend from the Galatian Academy from the tutorial mission
		- Also given when tutorial is skipped

- Sustained Burn:
	- Now gives +100% burn instead of +10
		- Means that bonuses to ship burn level (i.e. Augmented Drive Field) are doubled
		- While fleetwide bonuses (tugs, Nav Buoy, etc) are not
	- Slightly increased arc in which it has the highest acceleration penalty
	- Reduced charge up/down time to half a second (was: 2.5 seconds up, 1 second down)
	- Goals are to )1 make burn level of ships mean more and 2) encourage turning SB off sometimes

- Emergency Burn:
	- Reduced supply cost by half (was: 50% of total deployment cost of fleet, now 25%)
	- Burn bonus increased to +8 (was: +5)

- Navigation: level 3 now gives +1 to maximum burn and an additional +1 when Sustained Burn is on

- Known hullmods no longer drop or show up for sale

- Buying up hullmods will NOT increase the odds of remaining ones showing up

- Fleet Logistics: maintenance reduction reduced to 25% (was: 30%)

- Derelict ships in campaign will now show ship type in the tooltip, i.e. "Derelict Ship (Dram-class Light Tanker)"

- Salvaging mechanics:
	- "Salvage rating" no longer a player-facing stat; still affects crew/machinery needed
		- Removed "blow it up" option as it's no longer relevant
	- Salvaging skill provides up to a 50% bonus to finding resources and rare items
	- Recovery of resources is affected by:
		- Having enough crew (multiplier, 0 to 1)
		- Having enough heavy machinery (+0 to +100%)
		- Salvaging skill (up to +50%)
		- Salvage Rigs / other ships with salvaging capacity; diminishing returns for more ships
			- Ships must be at at least 10% combat readiness for bonus to apply
	- A fraction of the total bonus also applies to post-combat salvage
	- Recovery of rare items is only affected by the Salvaging skill
		- Not affected by not having enough crew, machinery, or any other modifiers
	- Goals are:
		- Clean up the flow by removing the "blow up then scavenge" option
		- Allow player to specialize in getting a lot more value out of it
		- Ensure that salvaging something will not feel like a wasted opportunity due to missing out on likely-otherwise-inaccessible items such as blueprints
		- Give Salvaging skill long-term value - it grants access to 50% more stuff that would otherwise be hard or impossible to get
		- Make salvaging without the skill but with Salvage Rigs a viable option, both in terms of rare items and resources gained

- When exploring a ship wreck, added notification when there's cargo on board

- When the player's net monthly income is negative and they run out of credits:
	- Credits set to 0
	- Custom production of ships and weapons is halted
	- When this goes on for two months or more, some crew may leave next time the player's fleet comes into port
	- Can be countered by shutting down industries on owned colonies - reduces expenses and gives back most of the credits used to establish the industry

- Monthly salary for unassigned colony administrators reduced to 10% of base

- Reduced strength of scavenger fleets

- Some of the pirate fleets that show up in pirate activity/bounty systems will congregate near jump-points and pirate colonies, making them easier to find

- Transponder-off trade:
	- No longer has any impact on reputation or, for black market trade, suspicion level
	- (Previously: had a smaller-than-normal effect; goal is a more clear distinction)

- Increased maximum player level to 50 for the moment; pending another look at skills

- Added lists of best places to buy/sell to commodity tooltip

- Added common "delivery" mission
	- Encountered in dockside bars
	- Take and deliver X amount of commodity to another colony
	- Medium reward; usually takes player to semi-dangerous systems (i.e. pirate activity etc)
	- Volume of commodities and reward depends on player's fleet
	- Different version when offered at player-owned colony

- Planet tooltip: now shows survey level for uninhabited and faction name for inhabited

- During salvage, when finding information about the location of another entity of interest nearby:
	- Will no longer point to small derelict ships, only cruisers and larger
	- This also means that more of these will point to other, larger structures
		- (Since no longer diluting the pool of potential targets with larger number of chaff)

- Course widget: made data font bigger

- Added new carrier-specific d-mods:
	- Malfunctioning Comms - reduces fighter engagement range
	- Defective Manufactory - reduces fighter speed and increases fighter damage taken
		- Affected fighters have a "damaged" visual overlay

- Changed cargo tabs to "All" "Resources" "Ship weapons" and "Other" (i.e combined "Commodities" and "Crew")

- Increased number of crew recovered from "cryopods with crew" exploration special

- Changed hazard rating to be based around 100% base instead of 0% base, since that's how it's used

- Reduced production of commodities by Heavy Industry; high production levels now require special items or a very large colony

- Added notification message when industry construction completes; can click to open colony screen

- Added notification for when colony size increases; can click to open colony screen

- Changed intel UI tags to be OR instead of AND

- Removed Surveying skill; can now survey planets with any hazard rating
	- Increased cost by a flat +10 supplies
	- Significantly reduced the value of survey data (30k for Class V; was: 100k)

- Revamped and simplified economy:
	- Colonies have a single accessibility value which determines how much they can import and export
	- Accessibility also affects colony growth
	- Combined demand for a commodity generates a total "market value"
	- Export income is determined by a colony's "market share", which is based on production and accessibility

- When interacting with fleet that has a low reputation impact and fighting which won't cause instant hostilities: added text to that effect

- Ships recovered after combat will retain known hullmods

- Weapons and fighters on your ships have a 100% chance to be recovered if the ship is recoverable

- Recovery Operations:
	- Removed bonus to own fighter/weapon recovery
	- Increased recovery bonus for enemy ships/weapons/fighters to 25% (was: 15%)

- Can "abandon" a size-3 colony; requires paying for (significant) evacuation expenses

- Can "stabilize" a colony that's suffering from Recent Unrest
	- Maximum equal to Recent Unrest minus one
		- Can not be used to increase stability of a colony not suffering from unrest
	- Cost based on amount stabilized and colony size
	- Expensive - generally not worth it purely to improve colony income through higher stability
		- Primarily a means to stave off the decivilization of a bombarded/raided colony


### Terrain

- Hyperspace storms:
	- Fixed tooltip
	- Removed sensor profile penalty and speed penalty
	- Changed CR drain effect to powerful "storm strikes" hitting random ships
	- A strike reduces CR and deals armor/hull damage, but can't destroy a ship
	- Larger fleets attract more powerful strikes
	- Some strikes will not deal any damage - at most 1 every 5 seconds (on average) will
	- Each strike gives the fleet a speed boost in a direction determined by the fleet's position relative to the storm cell and its speed
	- Speed beyond burn level 20 does not cost extra fuel
	- While speed-boosted, the fleet may briefly lose steering control
		- Emergency Burn allows control while boosted
	- Strikes are synced up with the "cloud lightning" visual/audio effects
	- Entering an active hyper cell will cause a flurry of storm strikes - i.e, the timing is predictable
	- Overall:
		- Potential for more severe damage to individual ships
		- Much less expensive in total, and lower per-day costs since not all ships are affected
		- Situationally useful for faster travel

- Deep hyperspace:
	- Now slows down larger fleets more than small ones

- Nebula:
	- Now slows down larger fleets more than small ones
	- Removed in-combat effect on ship speed

- Asteroid belts/fields:
	- Do not slow down fleets directly
	- Chance of "asteroid impacts" on the drive field, briefly knocking the fleet off course
		- Heavier impacts on larger fleets
		- Navigation skill helps mitigate impacts

- Magnetic field:
	- Now reduces the range at which a fleet within can be detected by 75%
	- When in magnetic storm, range is reduced by 100%, and the sensors of the fleet have their range reduced by 90%
	- Goal: useful for sneaking around and hiding in

- In general: terrain that slows down fleets is where smaller fleets can run to get away from larger fleets


### Ships

- Tempest:
	- Increased maintenance/deployment cost to 8
	- Replaced Active Flare Launcher with High Energy Focus
	- Terminator Drone:
		- Changed wing size to 2
		- Reduced replacement time to 10 seconds
		- Reduced top speed; engines can no longer flame out
		- Changed type to "support" with 0 roam range
		- Added "Terminator Core" hullmod
			- Increases damage to missiles and fighters 2x
			- Gives perfect target leading
			- Increases beam range
			- PD weapons ignore flares
		- Now armed with a PD Laser and IR Pulse Laser
		- Overall:
			- Excellent anti-fighter and point-defense
			- Limited usefulness as anti-ship support due to no roam and low weapon range

- Colossus, all 3 versions: significantly cheaper to buy

- Colossus Mk2, Mk3:
	- Added Civilian-grade Hull (not a nerf)

- Prometheus:
	- Reduced fuel capacity to 2500
	- Changed ship system to Flare Launcher

	- Reduced fuel/light-year to 8 (was: 10)
	- Increased OP by 10
	- Reduced top speed to 70 (was 80)
	- Ship system changed to "Plasma Burn"

		- Can still steer and use shields, but can't move backwards
		- Stores up to two charges

- Aurora: reduced flux capacity by 1000 and flux dissipation by 50

- Ox-class Tug: reduced fuel cost/light year to 5 (was: 10)

	- Plasma Burn ship system
	- Medium missile slot and good energy-based firepower
	- Fast and very fragile

- Added XIV Battlegroup ship not available to the Hegemony


### Weapons

- Ion Cannon, Ion Pulser: EMP arcs now deal 100% of base non-EMP damage instead of 25%

- Devastator Cannon: reduced number of particles from explosions

- Weapons that use ammo now retain their ammo count across multiple engagements
	- In other words, re-deploying a ship will not cause its weapons to be reloaded

- Autopulse Laser: increased charges to 30 (was: 20)

- Plasma Cannon:
	- Damage reduced to 500 and and flux/shot reduced to 550
	- Fires 3-shot bursts every 2 seconds
	- Increased turn rate substantially
	- Will no longer autofire against fighters

	- Range reduced to 700
	- Burst size increased to 15 (was 10), reduced per-shot recoil
	- Rate of fire within burst doubled
	- Increased refire delay to keep same DPS as before
	- Flux per shot increased to 50 (was: 40)

- Heavy Needler:
	- Burst size increased to 30, reduced per-shot recoil
	- Rate of fire within burst doubled
	- Increased refire delay, overall DPS increased from 214 to 250
	- Flux per shot increased to 50 (was: 40)

- Light AC, Light Dual AC: significantly increased turn rate

- Arbalest AC: reduced flux cost per shot to 120 (was: 170)

- Hurricane MIRV:
	- Made missile and warheads more visible
	- Number of warheads is 9
	- Warheads are now two-stage (aim then unguided burn), but much more accurate
	- Increased refire delay to 15 (was: 5)
	- Submunition accuracy significantly impacted by ECCM/Missile Specialization

- Heavy Mauler: increased refire delay to 1.5 seconds (was: 1)

- Light Mortar: increased range to 600 (was: 500) and improved accuracy somewhat

- Pilum LRM: reduced OP cost to 7 (was: 10)

- Sabot (all):
	- Improved acceleration and turn rate
	- Increased submunition spread to 20 degrees (was: 15)
	- Improved aim/target leading of first stage

- Sabot Pod: reduced burst size to 2

- MIRV missiles can now split early when at close range and in-flight for over a second


### Fighters

- Fighters from the same carrier will now coordinate their attacks if launched together and given the proper distance to do so

- Ordering fighters to engage builds flux up to slightly above 5%

- Fighter replacement rate now goes down as long as the majority of wings have a missing fighter
	- Note that this is coupled with fixing a bug that caused a lowered rate to apply twice
	- Thus: not a nerf overall

- Claw: replaced Ion Cannon with Ion Cannon (High Delay) that has a significantly lower rate of fire

- Khopesh: reduced number of rockets per pod to 5 (was: 7)

- Mining Pod: substantially increased durability

- Talon: increased OP cost to 2 (was: 0)

- Warthog:
	- Wing size reduced to 2 (was: 3)
	- Removed one of the three light mortars
	- Reduced flux stats to roughly halve the remaining firepower after a brief initial burst


### Hullmods

- Converted Hangar:
	- Removed fighter replacement rate penalty
	- Can now re-launch returned fighters quickly, i.e. useful for bombers
	- Fighters have reduced stats and d-mod overlay as if the ship had a Defective Manufactory d-mod
		- (-33% speed, +50% damage taken)
	- OP cost for bombers increased by 100%; by 50% for all other fighters

- Converted Cargo Bay (Colossus Mk.3 built-in):
	- Same changes, except for OP cost

- Advanced Turret Gyros: +75% weapon turn speed (was: 50%)

	- Reduced shield arc penalty to 33% (was: 50%)
	- Reduced OP cost to match Hardened Shields

- Unstable Injector: now also increases fighter replacement time by 25%

- Certain hullmods can now only be installed at a colony with a spaceport or an orbital station
	- These are all tagged with "Logistics" and affect a ship's campaign stats
	- Limited to 2 per ship, not including any built-in logistics mods (such as Surveying Equipment on the Apogee)
	- Goal is to make these a long-term commitment, especially prior to an expedition to the fringes

- High Resolution Sensors:
	- Can now be learned and installed on other ships. Bonus for capital ships increased.
	- Can be bought from certain factions
	- Also unlocked at Sensors level 3

### Combat

- Adding new assignments is free while the command frequency is open

- Waypoints for new assignments will always be created at least 3000 units (3 map grid squares) from the map border

- Ordering fighters to "engage" will set a ships minimum flux level to slightly over 5%

- Reserve Deployment:
	- Does not add extra craft for bombers
	- Adds up to 1 (wing size 3 or less) or 2 (wing size > 3) for other fighter types

- Fortress Shield: increased charge up/down time to 1.5 seconds (was: 1)

- Damper Field:
	- Now reduces damage by 67% for frigates and destroyers; 50% for cruisers and capitals
	- Damper-field-using frigates should only rarely show up in smaller faction fleets

- Quantum Disruptor: removed energy damage penalty

- Fixed a number of admiral AI issues that made it use its ships in a highly suboptimal manner
	- Spends a bit of time capturing objectives, then orders a consistent full assault


### Ship AI

- Fixed bug that occasionally caused the Piranha to drop bombs right on top of friendly ships, including the carrier that it came from

- Fixed bug that caused the Flash bomber to fire phase charges in an unsafe manner
	- (This was a different bug than the above)

- Improved escort behavior - fixed a few positional bugs that caused escorting ships to get in the wrong position for what they wanted to do

- Fixed some issues with carriers not sending out fighters to attack

- Cleaned up a few cases of the AI backing off unnecessarily

- Ships that find themselves chasing smaller enemies far away from the action will try to rejoin their allies
	- Still possible for them to be separated, but requires the enemy to screen them off

- Fixed some cases of burn drive being used to move away from the desired direction (when retreating, escorting, moving to an assigned objective, etc)

- Fixed issue that caused Khopesh to mostly not fire its rockets at frigates

- Fixed bug that caused the AI to only rarely fire Sabots and other kinetic missile weapons vs frigates
	- (Were treated as "strike" weapons for that particular case)

- Improved range-management for "cautious" AI personality - should now keep in range more reliably if outranging the enemy's non-missile weapons
 

### Miscellaneous

- Revamped UI for adding hullmods to ships
	- Sorting and tag-based filtering
	- Can add/remove multiple hullmods without closing dialog
	- Can adjust vents/capacitors and see ship stats while in dialog

- Refit screen stats tooltip now shows ship system

- Changed "primary role" strings for weapons to more accurately reflect their actual combat roles, e.g. instead of "Assault" or "Close Support", it's "Anti Armor" or "Anti Shield" or "Point Defense (Area)" etc

- Added sensor strength and sensor profile to ship stats tooltip/info panel

- A crash during saving should no longer corrupt the savefile

- Launcher will now limit maximum resolution displayed to half of native for 4k monitors; goal is to point to "intended" use of half-native-resolution in fullscreen mode in that case
	- "4kThreshold" in data/config/settings.json if use of higher resolution is desired

- Increased number of simultaneous sound sources to 128 (was: 64)

- New icon for Expanded Magazines hullmod

- Hullmods tagged with "req_spaceport" can now only be added or removed at a colony with a spaceport or an orbital station
	- Can have arbitrary requirements for colony defined per hullmod in the effect plugin

- Projectile weapons only: LINKED or DUAL barrelMode weapons will now multiply the weapon_data.csv flux cost by the number of barrels that fire simultaneously
