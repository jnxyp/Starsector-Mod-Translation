istl_baikal,SHIP,"This heavy multi-role cruiser is an aging but flexible design, capable of handing nearly any requirement from convoy escort to fleet command ship to aggressive salvage operations in disputed zones. Once considered hopelessly obsolete, the current Block VI update features an all-new shield generator and improved high-output thrusters, as well as an integral salvage gantry for recovery operations.",,,
istl_baikal_brone,SHIP,"This heavy multi-role cruiser is an aging but flexible design, capable of handing nearly any requirement from convoy escort to fleet command ship to aggressive salvage operations in disputed zones. The addition of a 'Brone V' composite armor package gives this older model improved staying power, at the cost of even worse handling.",,,
istl_borzoi,SHIP,"A tough, agile light craft, lacking a shield but generously armored. Many commanders consider them invaluable for reconnaisance and pursuit duty, but shy away from sending them into heavier combat.",,,
istl_bouclier,SHIP,"Durable, flexible, and increasingly rare since the initial production run finished, these heavily armored courier shuttles are nevetheless still seen around the sector from time to time.",,,
istl_carabao,SHIP,"A thoroughly unremarkable tanker, reasonably well protected and dependable.",,,
istl_centaur,SHIP,"This chunky armed transport is the result of a long and exacting development process, aimed at designing the ultimate survivable cargo platform. Well armed and heavily shielded, the Kentaurus is an excellent choice for shipping in high-intensity combat zones.",,,
istl_chamois,SHIP,"A rough and tumble utilitarian hull, heavily armored against close impacts but saddled with a weak shield generator. Generous equipment racks permit various utility modifications, and a cramped drone bay offers the possibility of a light carrier configuration to the desperate.",,,
istl_damselfly,SHIP,"Deploying a salvo of Perforator rockets, these tough bombers can inflict horrifying damage to enemy shipping from stand-off ranges.",,,
istl_dard,SHIP,"A cheap, lightweight drone fighter. Low-power beam weaponry relegates the Dard to interception duty.",,,
istl_defstation,SHIP,"A standardized frame for defensive fortifications. Hexagonal truss construction allows the fitting of 50% more modules compared to Domain-standard construction, but the resulting platform is still not comparable to a full-sized battlestation. Fleet planners consider this an acceptable tradeoff, preferring larger mobile forces to fixed defenses in any case.",,,
istl_devilray,SHIP,"A fearsome phase destroyer design, optimized for hit-and-run guerilla warfare. While no more of these ships have been produced in some time and maintenance requirements are steep, a rugged, modular design allows nonfunctional ships to be quickly cannibalized to keep the rest flying.",,,
istl_egret,SHIP,"The Aigrette is a dedicated space-superiority design that marries a durable chassis with advanced weapons to create an aggressive, predatory fighter capable of wiping the floor with other small craft. The addition of flare launchers further frustrates commanders who rely on missile-armed fighters.",,,
istl_feeder,SHIP,"Small mercenary groups often have a need for bare-bones carrier support, and the Feeder conversion of the Carabao hull has been a runaway success. It won't win any style awards, but budget-conscious United Securities commanders praise the Feeder's ability to repair and replenish fighters from a single, cramped internal bay.",,,
istl_fighter_platform,SHIP,"This standardized fighter platform is an unremarkable product, churned out by the dozens to maintain Dassault-Mikoyan orbital fortifications throughout the sector. While not the equal of truly dedicated fortress stations, it performs adequately when supported by a defending fleet.",,,
istl_firespray,SHIP,"A durable light bomber, equipped with a small rack of plasma rockets for disabling weapons and engines. Repeat passes by multiple wings can leave even the hardiest ships crippled and drifting.",,,
istl_flare,SHIP,"An unremarkable heavy fighter design, employing missiles and machine guns to sweep down enemy fighters and pressure shielding. Keen-eyed observers will note their excellent handling.",,,
istl_flatmouse,SHIP,"Sometimes, simplest is best, and the Flatmouse exemplifies friendly simplicity. Armed with a single universal turret, it sells best to small, independent operators looking for something that can handle insystem cargo in style.",,,
istl_fletcher,SHIP,"An unremarkable light bomber, deploying a unique energy torpedo that's equally effective against both shields and armor.",,,
istl_grand_union,SHIP,"Designed as much to project a public image of nobility and trust as for durability and firepower, these heavyweight destroyers were built to order for United Securities. Fleet commanders from the major naval forces look down on the lack of missile armament, though, and the frontal shield is a liability in large engagements.",,,
istl_guardian_turret,SHIP,"An advanced automated gun platform, emplaced around sigma worlds to deal with interlopers. The addition of a long-ranged teleport makes them much more dangerous than ordinary, immobile defenses.",,,
istl_gun_platform,SHIP,"This standardized gun platform is an unremarkable product, churned out by the dozens to maintain Dassault-Mikoyan orbital fortifications throughout the sector. While not the equal of truly dedicated fortress stations, it performs adequately when supported by a defending fleet.",,,
istl_harridan,SHIP,"A fast, maneuverable fighter-bomber with EMP weaponry and a heavy missile armament. Enemy pilots are advised to treat Harridans with respect; short of heavy shielding, very few enemy fighters can withstand the missile barrage for long.",,,
istl_hellion,SHIP,"A brutal heavy fighter, armed with a small autocannon and fitted with a miniature phase cloak. A plasma decoy system distracts anti-fighter weaponry, allowing the Hellion to loiter around a target for extended periods.",,,
istl_hummingbird,SHIP,"A cheap, nimble interceptor. What it lacks in survivability or firepower it makes up for in agility, speed, and above all affordability.

Skeptical observers contend that even a good interceptor is a soft-skinned deathtrap, but the often desperate recruits who pilot these craft argue that even the toughest fighter gets hit, unless it can be where the shot isn't.",,,
istl_icax,SHIP,"An outgrowth of skipspace propulsion research, the Icax heavy fighter forgoes ordinary phase cloaking for high maneuverability and teleportation, producing a unique design optimized for suppression attacks.",,,
istl_ifrit,SHIP,"Much like the commonly-modified Kite, this blocky small craft is an excellent missile platform with high maneuverability. Only the finicky nature of some of the missile systems keeps them relatively rare in Blade Breaker active service units.",,,
istl_imp,SHIP,"Derived from civilian racing drones, this daggerlike small craft is deployed en masse to overwhelm enemies. While it lacks the survivability of crewed frigates, it can be cheaply produced in volume.",,,
istl_iridium,SHIP,"A rough-and-tumble defense fighter, armed with area weapons and equipped with a robust shield generator.",,,
istl_jeannedarc,SHIP,"A heavy fleet carrier, designed to dominate the battlespace with high-capacity flight decks, a MIRAGE recall system and an impressive array of point defenses. The expense of constructing and maintaining such an enormous ship has, so far, kept them relatively rare.",,,
istl_kormoran,SHIP,"A new-model heavy cruiser design, oriented around high tactical speed and incredible frontal firepower. Careful layout of the secondary and tertiary batteries makes them difficult to flank.",,,
istl_leyte,SHIP,"While small carriers are typically conversions from freight craft, the d'Erlon was designed for escort duty from the ground up. Deficient missile-handling systems bar the type from mounting LRMs, but most captains prefer to take the d'Erlon into the thick of battle.",,,
istl_lodestar,SHIP,"Of an age and design spec similar to the Gemini, the Lodestar trades modularity for defensive firepower, deploying bit drones to fend off missiles and fighters. Wide turret arcs allow the ship to focus fire admirably, and a robust drive package ensures that your cargo will get through the toughest blockade.",,,
istl_lycosid,SHIP,"A nasty little interceptor, deployed mainly from Blade Breaker stations with one, simple objective; shred anything that gets close.",,,
istl_mindanao,SHIP,"Cut from the same cloth as the innovative Heron class, a more versatile slot layout and even greater deck capacity vaults this design into the role of carrier flagship in Dassault-Mikoyan fleets.",,,
istl_mouflon,SHIP,"A specialized assault landing transport, lacking a shield but equipped with several ablative plates of the 'Brone V' advanced composite armor. While not by any means suited to prolonged space combat, it's perfect for delivering and extracting marines in hostile landing zones.

Mouflon crews are notoriously sensitive about their ships' lack of shielding, and taunts on the subject ('I think something fell off your ship, man!') are liable to provoke fistfights in any dockside bar.",,,
istl_mystere,SHIP,"An older assault fighter, reconfigured as a support fighter-bomber. A smart flare launcher protects it from missile-armed interceptors.",,,
istl_naja,SHIP,"While Dassault-Mikoyan is primarily known for producing civilian and armed-merchanter designs, this ugly frigate testifies to their prowess in crafting respectable combat craft. While not the equal of a Brawler in a stand-up fight, the Kobra is absurdly mobile and flexible, offering a shrewd captain many outfitting options.",,,
istl_naja_mk1,SHIP,"Mark 1 Dassault-Mikoyan hulls are older models that have been kept flying by any means necessary. Proprietary or high-maintenance systems have been swapped for cheaper, more readily available components.
While Dassault-Mikoyan is primarily known for producing civilian and armed-merchanter designs, this ugly frigate testifies to their prowess in crafting respectable combat craft. While not the equal of a Brawler in a stand-up fight, the Kobra is absurdly mobile and flexible, offering a shrewd captain many outfitting options.",,,
istl_puddlejumper,SHIP,"A rugged light freighter, generously armed for its size. Many Puddle Jumper captains swear by their trusty craft... when they aren't swearing at them.",,,
istl_puddlejumper_mk1,SHIP,"Mark 1 Dassault-Mikoyan hulls are older models that have been kept flying by any means necessary. Proprietary or high-maintenance systems have been swapped for cheaper, more readily available components.
A rugged light freighter, generously armed for its size. Many Puddle Jumper captains swear by their trusty craft... when they aren't swearing at them.",,,
istl_pup,SHIP,"An obsolete assault fighter, faithfully upgraded but now firmly behind the curve in speed and firepower. A tough frame and promiscuously available spares keep Pups flying in pirate and trade fleets around the sector.",,,
istl_rafale,SHIP,"A dependable shielded bomber wing, capable of accomodating multiple payload types. A smart flare launcher and an extra layer of ablative armor make the Rafale unusually survivable.",,,
istl_samoyed,SHIP,"When the Collapse hit the Nikolaev system, one of the first vessels Dassault-Mikoyan produced was this scrappy scout vessel, appropriately named for a loyal working animal. Now, Shalaikas are one of the company's most popular export designs, marrying a respectable cargo hold with powerful defenses.",,,
istl_sevastopol,SHIP,"An exceptionally durable vessel, produced in limited quantities as a better-protected alternative to the Tarsus. With superior fire arcs and a powerful, efficient shield, few freighter captains who own one would trade back.",,,
istl_sevastopol_mk1,SHIP,"Mark 1 Dassault-Mikoyan hulls are older models that have been kept flying by any means necessary. Proprietary or high-maintenance systems have been swapped for cheaper, more readily available components.
An exceptionally durable vessel, produced in limited quantities as a better-protected alternative to the Tarsus. With superior fire arcs and a powerful, efficient shield, few freighter captains who own one would trade back.",,,
istl_snowgoose,SHIP,"While the Medusa set the standard for phase-skimming fast destroyers, this up-and-coming design is stiff competition. The Snow Goose is built around a tough, high-capacity flux frame with integrated point-defense beamers, allowing the ship to skip in and out of heavy fire-zones, intercepting multiple fighters or missiles simultaneously. A flexible turret layout allows the Snow Goose to focus on single targets or suppress swarms of smaller enemies with punishing, liquid firepower.",,,
istl_starsylph,SHIP,"These pricy luxury craft, while not the equal of a dedicated high-end combat frigate like the Tempest, have carved out a respectable niche for themselves as escort ships and secure couriers. Alas, the high sticker price has kept them out of the hands of many a sharp customer who could put a Star Sylph's more... exotic... features to good use.",,,
istl_stoat,SHIP,"True to their name, Husky frigates are tough and adaptable, and generous weapon arcs married to a powerful shield generator make them an excellent choice for protecting larger ships from bombers. A Goalkeeper drone provides area defense.",,,
istl_stoat_c,SHIP,"True to their name, Husky frigates are tough and adaptable, and generous weapon arcs married to a powerful shield generator make them an excellent choice for protecting larger ships from bombers. The Goalkeeper drone is swapped out for decoy flares on this customized export version.",,,
istl_stormkestrel,SHIP,"A powerful escort cruiser, designed around the need to operate for extended periods without resupply. Generous automation allows these ships to act as command nodes for task forces, while a flight deck enables them to project power across great distances.",,,
istl_tereshkova,SHIP,"Compact and efficient, the Tereshkova is a small survey vessel intended primarily for sale to the budget-conscious settlement authority or tech-mining firm. While in no sense competition for the venerable Apogee, these ships have a solid niche providing sensor management and fire support in smaller exploration fleets.",,,
istl_thunderbolt,SHIP,"An outsized heavy fighter, designed around a pair of capacitor-driven laser units and an SRM turret. While slow, the inclusion of a frontal shield generator makes these clumsy craft more survivable than they first appear.",,,
istl_tunguska,SHIP,"Designed to excel in small-scale skirmish combat, the Tunguska is a stiletto-shaped artillery destroyer with outsized firepower for its frame. Larger engagements see Tunguskas relegated to the support role, sniping at capital ships from extreme range.",,,
istl_vesper,SHIP,"A high-speed attack frigate with an absurdly versatile menu of fitting options. Vesper crews are reknowned for their recklessness and penchant for endless customization; a Vesper flown carefully or with stock parts would, after all, be a terrible waste of potential.",,,
istl_wanderer,SHIP,"These trim ships are unremarkable but solid destroyer-class combatants, respected for their hardy internals and solid drive performance.",,,
istl_zelenograd,SHIP,"A hulking survey ship, built immediately post-Collapse to spearhead aggressive tech mining and exploration efforts. Over the years, the various iterations of the Zelenograd have been up-armored and refitted with heavier and heavier weapons packages, until the final product is more of a pocket dreadnought than a large science vessel.",,,

istl_6cmrailgun,WEAPON,An advanced shield-suppression weapon. trading rate of fire for punishing damage and accuracy. The extremely high velocity of each shot lends it limited armor-piercing ability as well.,Close Support,,
istl_12cmrailgun,WEAPON,"A hypervelocity shield-busting weapon, firing accurate, powerful slugs at impressive range. The only drawback is a low fire rate, making it less effective against small, fast targets.",Close Support,,
istl_20cmrailgun,WEAPON,"An enormous, high-powered kinetic weapon, hurling devastating electromagnetic thunderbolts against enemy shields. A low rate of fire and ponderous turn speed put this weapon firmly in the anti-capital niche.",Close Support,,
istl_AMMblistertube,WEAPON,"A small launcher firing a container of high-speed micro missiles. Should not be available, if it is, bug report, please.",Fire Support,,
istl_AMMblisterlauncher,WEAPON,A heavy launcher firing containers of high-speed micro missiles. Generous internal magazines allow it to fire for an extended period of time.,Fire Support,,
istl_ammftr,WEAPON,"This simple, compact unit launches and fires Itano AMMs in bursts of three rounds. Low ammunition capacity is offset by an autoloader, allowing sustained, if slow, fire during long engagements.",Anti-Fighter,,
istl_ammlight,WEAPON,"This simple, compact unit launches and fires Itano AMMs in bursts of six rounds, saturating point-defenses and overwhelming fighters. Accurate mesotronic guidance makes them difficult to evade.",Anti-Fighter,,
istl_ammpod,WEAPON,"This simple, compact unit launches and fires Itano AMMs in bursts of eight rounds, saturating point-defenses and overwhelming fighters. Accurate mesotronic guidance makes them difficult to evade.",Anti-Fighter,,
istl_autohybridblaster,WEAPON,"A terrifying multiple-barrel hybrid blaster, designed to pound shields and melt armor with a barrage of white-hot positron bolts.",Assault,,
istl_autolaser,WEAPON,"A rapid-firing multiple laser mount designed for mid-range suppression of small and medium combatants. Compared to standard pulse lasers, armor damage is deficient, but perfect flux efficiency and high bolt speed improve performance against shields.",Assault,,
istl_autolaser_small,WEAPON,"A trio of light lasers mounted in a common housing, ideal for suppressing enemy shields and fighter craft. High bolt speed makes these weapons a perfect fit against faster, shielded enemies.",Assault,,
istl_basilisk,WEAPON,"A monstrous high-powered shockbeam, capable of devastating strikes. Imperfections in hull armor have a tendency to fail explosively as the intense beam passes over them.",Close Support,,
istl_blazedriver,WEAPON,"A heavy repeating blaster, projecting a brief burst of fast, inaccurate energy bolts at medium range.

The blaze repeater is inferior in most respects to a standard pulse laser, but plenty of independent starship captains favor them for their handiness against fighters and light frigates. Some keen observers have also noted that the flurry of shots very effectively brings down shields.",Assault,,
istl_blazegun,WEAPON,"A light repeating blaster, projecting a brief burst of fast, inaccurate energy bolts at medium range.

Blaze guns are a previous generation of Dassault-Mikoyan energy weapon, widely considered inferior to the effective and common lasers found in the rest of the sector. Huge stockpiles remain, however, and they're most often seen on exported hulls, recycled for an aftermarket that sees few energy weapon sales of any kind, and is grateful for whatever it gets.",Assault,,
istl_buzzgun,WEAPON,"Even more pathetic than its twin-mounted cousin, this single-barreled buzz gun is the point defense weapon of last resort.",Point Defense,,
istl_chasseurLRMlauncher,WEAPON,"A fearsome multiple-warhead kinetic support missile, used to disrupt enemy formations at range and spike shields.

While Chasseurs will never be common, many skeptical captains have warmed up to the weapon for close strike use; unlike the Squall, the cloud of Voltigeur submunitions arrive closely-spaced if not simultaneously, and the launching ship can retreat immediately after the missile is fired.",Close Support,,
istl_clusterlauncher,WEAPON,"A long-range cluster munition, deploying concussive electron bomblets to soften up enemy formations from a distance. Due to the size of the ammunition, the autoloader can falter in long engagements.

Rumor has it this weapon was originally developed with an eye to destroying shieldless enemies by surprise, though whether this means civilian shuttles in dock, or Domain autodefenses, no one beyond the design team knows for sure.",Fire Support,,
istl_erpulsebeam,WEAPON,"A long-range combat laser; an advanced, but unremarkable design, effective against fighters and unshielded ships. Damage falls off with range.",Close Support,,
istl_gravmissilelauncher,WEAPON,Advanced EMP/fragmentation missile launcher capable of rapid fire. Ample internal magazines. The missile's unstable warhead delivers 50-250 extra damage on hits to armor or hull.,Fire Support,,
istl_gravmissiletube,WEAPON,Advanced EMP/fragmentation missile tube capable of rapid fire. Small internal magazine. The missile's unstable warhead delivers 50-250 extra damage on hits to armor or hull.,Fire Support,,
istl_heavylrpd,WEAPON,"A powerful combat laser, capable of ruinous damage. To minimize damage to the mount, it's fired only in short bursts. Damage falls off with range.",Strike,,
istl_hedgehog_pod,WEAPON,"Launches a 12-round salvo of proximity-fuzed explosive bombs. Due to the low velocity of the bombs, this weapon is typically mounted only by stations.",Fire Support,,
istl_hellhoundlauncher,WEAPON,"If ordinary Hellriders were bad, this magazine-fed launcher unit is worse. Holding twelve rounds, it can pump out the hellish blue thunderbolts fast enough to devastate all but the heaviest shields and armor.

Tube-launched Hellrider missiles had to overcome a variety of teething problems to reach the market; the consequences of a missile jamming in the loading mechanism were more than a little daunting for Dassault-Mikoyan engineers. The final design places a high premium on safety; accidental detonation of the projectile is vanishingly unlikely, although aftermarket tinkerers continue to blow themselves up trying to improve on the design.",Strike,,
istl_hellhound,WEAPON,"Mad, bad, and dangerous to know, the Hellrider missile marries a high-yield metastable warhead to a devilishly fast drive unit and excellent guidance. This twin rack is the most common mounting.

Hellrider pursuit missiles were one of the first commercially successful Dassault-Mikoyan weapon designs to reach the sector; while neither as promiscuously available as the Harpoon, nor quite as powerful as the Atropos, the high average hit rate speaks for itself, to many captains; a Hellrider will follow a target through almost any evasive maneuver a living crew can survive, and has the speed to catch anything that can't teleport.",Strike,,
istl_hellhound_single,WEAPON,"Mad, bad, and dangerous to know, the Hellrider missile marries a high-yield metastable warhead to a devilishly fast drive unit and excellent guidance. This single unit is a common mounting.

Hellrider pursuit missiles were one of the first commercially successful Dassault-Mikoyan weapon designs to reach the sector; while neither as promiscuously available as the Harpoon, nor quite as powerful as the Atropos, the high average hit rate speaks for itself, to many captains; a Hellrider will follow a target through almost any evasive maneuver a living crew can survive, and has the speed to catch anything that can't teleport.",Strike,,
istl_hellspear,WEAPON,"A gigantic electrothermal sniper weapon, designed to punch through heavy armor at long range. Long-rod penetrator rounds do up to 150 extra HE damage on hits to armor or hull.

As with similar weapons, the Hellspear's advantage over comparable heavy armor-piercers is the high velocity of its shots; Hellspear crews can engage targets at the outer edge of the weapon's range with a surprising hit rate. Some gun commanders use the weapon as an immense sniper rifle, hunting the battlespace for targets of opportunity from a distance.",Strike,,
istl_howler,WEAPON,"This electrothermal smoothbore gun is ideal for breaching armor, but suffers from a low rate of fire due to a complex loading mechanism. Long-rod penetrator rounds do up to 75 extra HE damage on hits to armor or hull.

'Remarkable for being totally unremarkable' sums up the Howler. The only notable design feature is the open-cycle cooling system, which allows the gun to use higher-energy propellants, and acheive correspondingly higher muzzle velocities, than would otherwise be the case.",Strike,,
istl_hybridblaster,WEAPON,"A supercharged pulse laser unit married to a blaster-type positron accelerator produces this fearsome energy weapon, which combines excellent armor-penetration with a high rate of fire.

Hybrid weaponry is a signature product of the Dassault-Mikoyan military line, and jealously guarded against export sales and competition. Tinkering with unlicensed hybrid weapons is an excellent way to blow yourself into constituent atoms; either by carelessly breaching the positron containment unit's shielding, or by disabling some vital piece of flux-regulating equipment.",Assault,,
istl_hybridrepeater,WEAPON,"A burst-firing light weapon, feared for the generous EMP payload. A rare sight in most fleets, it's a perennial favorite of experienced frigate captains with the right connections and ready credits.",Close Support,,
istl_impaler,WEAPON,"An unremarkable point-defense laser. Compared to the standard PD Laser, it has longer range, but poorer flux efficiency. Some crews have been known to tinker with these hardy mounts, setting them to preferentially target ships and fighters when in range.",Point Defense,,
istl_impaler_rapid,WEAPON,"A lightweight combat laser; excellent against fighters and light craft, but poor against enemy shields. Damage falls off with range.",Assault,,
istl_impulsor,WEAPON,"A compact point-defense mount, closely integrated into the hull. The low-power stream of particles often confuses missile guidance and stabilization systems, but penetration is extremely poor; the targeting AI excludes fighters and ships by design.",Point Defense,,
istl_ionbeamer_builtin,WEAPON,"An upsized particle beam weapon for dogfighting, this high-power unit is built into the Aigrette space-superiority fighter. Or was, this is a legacy description.",Close Support,,
istl_ionbeamer,WEAPON,"A larger, continuous-fire version of the tactical shockbeam. Imperfections in hull armor have a tendency to fail explosively as the intense beam passes over them.",Close Support,,
istl_jackal,WEAPON,"An unusual anti-armor weapon, firing a slow-moving, slicing projectile. In addition to their utility against armor, the sensor signature of the heavy blades very effectively decoys point defences.

One can only imagine what was going through the mind of this weapon's designer; 'let's make a gun that shoots knives!' sums up most of the likely guesses. As with most Blade Breaker weaponry, the design hints at vast sources of power used in manufacture and testing.",Assault (Exotic),,
istl_lens_hdem_single,WEAPON,"An advanced strike missile, which fires a spread of implosively-formed energy pulses on detonation.",Strike (Exotic),,
istl_lens_hdem_rack,WEAPON,"A rack of advanced strike missiles, which fire a spread of implosively-formed energy pulses on detonation.",Strike (Exotic),,
istl_linearcannon,WEAPON,"A magnetic accelerator gun in a proven housing, excellent for shield suppression but hampered by poor performance against armor.

While magnetic weapons are hardly unknown in the Sector, issues of barrel wear and complex electrical switching have prevented most from reaching their full potential. The use of sophisticated non-ferrous materials has made the Dassault-Mikoyan version vastly more practical in service, though not meaningfully less expensive.",Close Support,,
istl_linearcannonlight,WEAPON,"Smaller than the full-sized Linear Cannon, this version is configured for continuous fire, ideal for close suppression of shielded ships.

Fitted as standard to many civilian ships, these durable weapons often turn up in the defensive arsenals of planetary militias looking for a support weapon against shielded skimmers.",Close Support,,
istl_linearcannonheavy,WEAPON,"Enormous paired magnetic accelerators in a robust oscillating turret, firing heavy slugs at high velocity. Direct hits on an enemy hull often short out subsystems and start electrical fires.",Assault,,
istl_heavylinear_autogun,WEAPON,"A rapid-fire magnetic accelerator, firing short bursts to overwhelm enemy shields. Ideal for close suppression of shielded ships and for use on patrol frigates.",Close Support,,
istl_linearcannontwin,WEAPON,"A pair of magnetic accelerator guns in a powered mount, ideal for mid-range suppression of enemy shielding. Due to heating concerns, multiple mounts are preferred for maintaining a sustained barrage of fire.",Close Support,,
istl_linearflak_single,WEAPON,"Faster-firing than ordinary flak guns, this defensive turret will handily swat missiles and most fighters with bursts of proximity-fused shells.",Point Defense,,
istl_linearflak,WEAPON,"A twin-mounted flak weapon, firing rapid bursts of proximity-fused shells. Deadly to missiles and fighters.",Point Defense,,
istl_linearmg,WEAPON,"A subtle upgrade of the common light machine gun, this accelerator weapon fires short bursts of slugs to shred light targets and overload shields.",Close Support,,
istl_linearmgdual,WEAPON,Two linear accelerator guns synced up to fire alternating bursts. Continuous fire makes this weapon devastating against enemy shields in a short-range fight.,Close Support,,
istl_linearvulcan,WEAPON,A twin-barreled automatic weapon for close-in zone defense. Poor penetration is offset slightly by a blistering rate of fire.,Point Defense,,
istl_magdisruptor,WEAPON,"An aggressive anti-fighter support weapon, firing brief pulses that disable electrical systems.

Typically found as an integral mount, the various attempts to market it as a modular option have failed due to the short range and negligible armor penetration.",Close Support,,
istl_magpulser,WEAPON,"A flexible ionizing weapon, designed for anti-fighter defense. Damage is low, but just a few solid hits will disable turrets and engines.

Widely considered superior to the standard Ion Cannon, hybrid pulsers fire more rapidly and deliver more of their energy packet as penetrating damage rather than ionization. The effects on exposed flesh are not pretty.",Assault,,
istl_marteau_esm_rack,WEAPON,Launches pairs of 'Extended Sprint Attack Drive' missiles with low-yield warheads. Useful for stripping armor and finishing smaller enemies.,Assault,,
istl_marteau_esm_pod,WEAPON,Launches a salvo of 'Extended Sprint Attack Drive' missiles with low-yield warheads. Useful for stripping armor and finishing smaller enemies.,Assault,,
istl_microflak,WEAPON,"A simple, inexpensive brace of projector tubes, throwing proximity-fused anti-missile grenades in a preset pattern. Easily overwhelmed in long engagements, and struggles to hit fast targets at the best of times.",Point Defense,,
istl_micropd,WEAPON,"A slightly weaker, more affordable version of the common PD beamer, this compact unit is still adequate defense against missiles and fighters.",Point Defense,,
istl_mirvtorpedo_rack,WEAPON,"Simple semi-guided torpedoes, largely overshadowed by the superior damage or all-the-way-in guidance of other heavy missiles. Not recommended for use against fast targets, but highly effective.",Strike,,
istl_mirvtorpedo_single,WEAPON,"A simple semi-guided torpedo, largely overshadowed by the superior damage or all-the-way-in guidance of other heavy missiles. Not recommended for use against fast targets, but highly effective.",Strike,,
istl_multipdnode,WEAPON,"These flexible emitter heads link in to a common power source and targeting computer, providing the vessel with accurate point defense capable of handling multiple targets.",Point Defense,,
istl_NTKautogun,WEAPON,"A compact revolver cannon with a high rate of fire, often pressed into service as point-defense. Has a 10% chance of a 30-60 damage explosion on hits to armor or hull.",Assault/Aux PD,,
istl_NTKcannon,WEAPON,"An unremarkable anti-armor weapon with a decent rate of fire. Long-rod penetrator rounds do up to 30 extra HE damage on hits to armor or hull.

The Horn is widely regarded as a slow but highly effective brawling weapon but pilots familiar with Dassault-Mikoyan hardware; the armor penetration is excellent, and just one or two mixed into a battery of kinetics will help crack armor.",Close Support,,
istl_omniblaster,WEAPON,"A high-energy strike weapon, firing a short burst of positron bolts at close range. Secondary arcing can disable or overload ship systems.",Strike,,
istl_pdlaser,WEAPON,"A somewhat diffuse capacitor-based particle beam weapon, commonly mounted as point defense. Poor performance against armor and active defenses mars an otherwise elegant design.",Point Defense,,
istl_perforator,WEAPON,"These compact launch pods hold and fire three-round bursts of Perforator rockets, trading the volume fire of Annihilators for a smaller, more controllable burst of faster projectiles.",Strike,,
istl_perforatorpod,WEAPON,"The larger version of the reliable Perforator rocket pod, this high-capacity assault mount feeds pre-fused rockets from a drum, allowing it to maintain constant, devastating pressure on a target.

Appropriately for a weapon adapted from venerable ground-base artillery rockets, the Katyusha Perforator is also considered a staple weapon in the Land Forces of the Nikolaev System Authority. Lavish use of artillery has long been a staple feature of the Authority's brief planetary campaigns; Peremohy's small population can ill-afford human losses.",Strike,,
istl_plasbeamer,WEAPON,"A high-energy point defense weapon, expelling a short-ranged electroplasma stream by unknown means. Excellent in close combat as well.",Point Defense (Exotic),,
istl_plasmadisruptor,WEAPON,"A compact assault blaster, firing short bursts for zone defense against fighters. Power and fitting requirements are steep.",Assault (Exotic),,

Rad levels on the surface are truly staggering, and it�s hard to tell where the weather ends and plate tectonics begin.",
planet_marat,CUSTOM,"An icy, forbidding gas giant, Marat is a gorgeous sight, orbiting magisterially amid a swarm of frozen moons.",,,
planet_morningside,CUSTOM,"A barren, tide-locked cinder of a world, closely orbiting Martinique. The pitted rockscapes on the nightside are rumored to be favorite meeting points for smugglers and organ-leggers.",,"A cacophony of failed or failing beacons, set up at various times and for various purposes, dot the landscape with irregular, anemic pings, making the possibility of landing unusually complicated... ensuring that spacers in need of a little privacy will refresh the forest of dying antennae regularly.",
planet_odessa,CUSTOM,"A tempestuous ocean planet, dotted here and there by jagged windblown islands and tantalizing hints of alien life. Various proposals to establish outposts on Odessa are mooted regularly in Peremohy Highport's council chambers, but thus far none have come to fruition.",,"During the early settlement of the Nikolaev system, Odessa was earmarked for intensive aquaculture operations, but the Collapse put paid to any hopes of establishing a colony on such rough seas. Periodic orbital studies have identified herds of cetacean creatures whose complex behavior suggests a definite, though non-technological, sapience. Perhaps future generations of humanity will have the resources to attempt contact; for now, fragments of their ululating song and sonar mapping of likely spawning grounds will have to suffice.",
planet_pyla,CUSTOM,"A dusty rock with minimal value, Pyla orbits Gironde closely, coincidentally providing truly spectacular displays of auroral activity as the gas giant's magnetic field excites the thin atmosphere and conductive particles in the sand.",,"Passed over in the rush to colonize easier, more hospitable worlds, Pyla is still empty of permanent settlements, but a small number of illegal dune-skimmer rally races are held here biannually.",
planet_stendhal,CUSTOM,"A huge, imposing gas giant, Stendhal's massive gravity well sweeps the Nikolaev outer system clean of comets and other debris regularly; its equally massive radiation belts make gas mining impractical, but have spawned a few enterprising schemes to exploit them with power tethers.",,,
planet_rouge,CUSTOM,"A cracked, vulcanized rock, wrenched by Stendhal's massive gravity and scoured lifeless by intense radiation. Living things set foot here only rarely; even the most desperate smugglers think twice before setting down on Rouge.",,,
planet_noir,CUSTOM,"A blasted, radioactive moon of Stendhal, useful mainly as an orbital anchor for the busy R&D facility above. A few heavily-shielded geologists visit the surface yearly.",,,
planet_yod2,CUSTOM,"An enormous, hot gas giant with several moons, orbiting close to its giant primary. Roasted by Yod's baleful red glare, and pelted regularly by asteroids, comets, and other debris - an austere and beautiful sight, all told.",,"Yod II's storm clouds are impressive to behold at this short distance, but the number of objects pinging your collision radar are worrying.",
istl_DMEmegahab,CUSTOM,"Less of a space station and more of a self-sufficient artificial micromoon, Peremohy Highport is the commercial and financial center of the Nikolaev system, and a strictly regulated port with appealingly liberal tariff laws.",,,
istl_dme_lab,CUSTOM,"A research station, lightly protected but bristling with antennae and docking clamps.",,,
istl_dme_outpost,CUSTOM,"A commercial station, decently protected and stocked with trade goods and raw materials.",,,
istl_dme_industrial,CUSTOM,"A industrial station, decently protected and stocked with trade goods and raw materials.",,,
istl_dme_small,CUSTOM,"A small outpost, lightly protected and stocked with goods and raw materials.",,,
istl_powertether,CUSTOM,"A robust electrodynamic tether, deployed to provide power for any nearby industrial stations and mining facilities.",,,

dassault_mikoyan,FACTION,"Once a premier supplier of aerospace fighters to the Domain Navy, Dassault-Mikoyan Engineering was well-placed to become a secure, if small, regional power following the Collapse, with a prototyping autofactory and a self-contained test facility in the sector. In the centuries since, Dassault-Mikoyan has gained a reputation as a powerful and somewhat amoral corporate microstate that punches above its weight in interstellar affairs, though a strict charter and tradition of robust shareholder democracy blunts many of the worst excesses. Many of their Collapse-era prototype technologies have been refined into a unique and impressive shipbuilding style, exported widely.

Preferring to work behind the scenes and through proxy forces, numerous and wild conspiracy theories swirl around the company's current and future plans - how much truth they hold, no one outside the company can, or dares, say.",,,
6eme_bureau,FACTION,"As secretive as they are feared, the Sixth Bureau is an arm of the Nikolaev System Authority under the de-facto control of the Dassault-Mikoyan governing board. As such, it's typically employed for black ops against corporate rivals and terror-suppression missions aimed at containing the Blade Breakers.",,,
united_security,FACTION,"Scraped together from the dregs of the Askonia Crisis and not a few 'reformed' pirates, United Securities is unique among sector mercenary groups in acquiring long-term patronage within the boardroom of the Dassault-Mikoyan corporation, who furnish them with several custom-built or modified hulls and steady, long-term contract work, keeping them a lower risk for turning pirate than most mercs.",,,
blade_breakers,FACTION,"Politically incoherent and hopelessly violent, the Blade Breakers are obsessed with sigma worlds and their associated limitless energy potential. While no comprehensive account of their goals exists, it's safe to assume that their plans for the sector would involve multi-megadeaths, if not the total removal or liquidation of most planetary populations.",,,
