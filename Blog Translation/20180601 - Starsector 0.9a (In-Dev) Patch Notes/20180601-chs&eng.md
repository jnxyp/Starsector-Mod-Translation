## Campaign  生涯模式

- Colony building:
- 殖民地建设：
	- Player can establish a colony on a planet they've surveyed
	- 玩家可以在他们已探索的星球上建立殖民地
	- Requires crew, machinery, and supplies
	- （建设殖民地）需要船员，重型机械和补给
	- Can change the planet's name, either when colony is established or at any point later on
	- 可以在殖民地建立后任意更改行星名称
	- Can build "Industries" and "Structures" (same thing, mechanically) at a colony
	- 可以在殖民地建设“工业设施”和“结构”（实际上是一样的）
	- Some example ones 一些可以建造的东西:
		- Mining
		- 矿场
		- Farming
		- 农场
		- Spaceport
		- 星港
		- Heavy Industry
		- 重工业（造船）
		- Orbital stations (of several varieties)
		- 轨道站（包含多种）
		- Military Base
		- 军事基地
		- Tech-Mining
		- 科研机构
		- ... and a number of other ones
		- ...以及其他许多类型
	- Some industries can be upgraded, i.e. "Patrol HQ" -> "Military Base", or "Heavy Industry" -> "Orbital Works"
	- 一些工业设施可以被升级，例如“巡逻站”->“军事基地”，“重工工厂”->“轨道工业”
	- Most industries are known from the start, but a few more exotic ones can be learned
	- 大部分工业设施在游戏开始就可用，但还有一些特殊的设施需要学习才成建造
	- Can set a "stockpiling level" for a colony to have it build up extra resources the player can take
	- 可以为殖民地设定一个“储备等级”，以令殖民地为玩家生产更多可用的资源
		- Stockpiling costs credits, but somewhat less than the base cost of the commodities
		- 虽然进行资源储备需要花费资金，但仍然比市面上的商品的基础价格更加实惠
		- Stockpiles will be used to counter temporary shortages
		- 资源储备将会被用以应对暂时性的资源短缺
	- Player colonies have a "local resources" submarket where they can take from, or add to, stockpiles. There's a "storage" submarket for resources that must remain untouched.
	- 玩家的殖民地将会拥有一个“本地资源”子市场，玩家可以从中拿取或向其中储存资源。殖民地另有一个“仓储”子市场，用于存储那些不能被动用的资源。
	- Player colonies do **not** have an Open Market unless there's a "Commerce" industry
	- 玩家的殖民地**不会**有对外开放的市场，除非殖民地建设了“商贸”行业设施
	- Colonies start at size 3; population growth depends on many factors and can be directly invested into
	- 殖民地的起始市场规模为3；人口的增长取决于多种因素，并且可以通过投入移民来直接增加
	- Can assign AI cores to manage industries for various, significant benefits
	- 可以分配AI核心来管理工业设施，以获取多种多样的重要加成

	- 可以雇佣管理者（有上限）来管理你的殖民地
	- Can learn skills that improve the colonies under your control
	- 可以通过学习技能来改进你手下的殖民地
		- Maximum number under personal control is soft-limited - reduced stability for going beyond
		- 个人控制的殖民地数量有一个软性上限，超出数量上限将会导致（殖民地）稳定性下降
	- Can assign Alpha Cores to manage your colonies, for a massive benefit
	- 可以将Alpha 级人工智能核心分配用于管理殖民地，可以获得巨大的加成
	- Establishing the first colony also creates a new player faction
	- 第一个殖民地的建立将会创建一个新的玩家势力

		- 舰船的“生产质量”取决于许多因素，并会影响生产出舰船所包含的d船插个数
		- Can be improved by certain items found during exploration
		- （“生产质量”）可以被星系探索中发现的特定物品所提高
	- Some basic blueprints always known from the start, rest have to be acquired
	- 一些基础的蓝图在游戏开局就可用，而其余的则需要后来得到
	- Blueprints can be prioritized to get the desired fleet composition and weapon/fighter use
	- 为某些种类的蓝图设定优先级来生成你所要的舰队、武器和战机组合
	- Affect fleet production by player colonies
	- 影响玩家殖民地的舰队生产

- Fixed issue with too many carriers auto-escorting nearby combat ships
- Reduced tendency of carriers to assign their fighter wings to escort nearby ships instead of attacking
- Carriers assigned a "search & destroy" order will no longer use nearby ships to hide behind
- Improved logic for multiple ships not using too many total missiles vs a single target
- Fixed issue that was causing carriers to order fighters to "engage" too far from target, causing unnecessary loss of the 0-flux boost
- Fixed issue that was causing carriers with some support fighters to not order the other fighters to engage
- Fixed bug that caused a retreating ship with front shields to keep them on when it was not necessary
- More likely to set smaller groups to autofire when flux is low, including hardpoint groups

- Added MarketAPI.get/setEconGroup()
	- Markets within the same econ group only trade with each other and are not visible when viewing nearby markets etc from a market in a different group. Default group is null (the value, not the string).
- Added ShipAIPlugin.getConfig() method that returns a ShipAIConfig (or null if a custom ship AI doesn't support the core config parameters)
- Added "tags" and "rarity" columns to ship_data.csv
	- Skins do NOT inherit tags from the parent ship, but can have their own tags specified via a "tags" json array
	- Default d-hulls also do not inherit any tags from the base hull
- Added "tech/manufacturer" column to ship and weapon data
	- Defaults to "Common" if unspecified
	- "manufacturer" key to override in ship skin file
- SectorEntityTokens and MarketAPIs stored in a MemoryAPI will be replaced by their ids in save files, and restored on load
	- For this and other reasons, code must gracefully handle a case where an entity is put into memory but then is no longer there or *is* there but is no longer in any LocationAPI
- Removed dHullOverlaySmall/Large from hull_styles.json; replaced with single dHullOverlay, which should be large-ish and will tile to cover bigger hulls (instead of being upscaled)
- hull_styles.json: now 3 d-mod overlays per style; light/medium/heavy, in only one size
	- d-mod overlays tile for larger ships
- Moved get/setModuleVariant() methods from FleetMemberAPI to ShipVariantAPI
- Weapon group generation:
	- Added "GROUP_LINKED" and "GROUP_ALTERNATION" AI hints to weapon_data; will attempt to place weapons with those in separate groups and set them to linked or alternating
	- Added groupTag column to weapon_data; when set, will heavily favor placing weapons with same groupTag into the same group, without other weapons in it
	- Will not auto-generate weapon groups for AI fleets until combat starts, for performance reasons
- Fixed word-wrapping issue when a single word is too long for a line
- Added limited support for drones with SHIP collision class; will no longer crash into mothership
- Added "canUseWhileRightClickSystemOn" to ship system definitions
- Missiles now support the "jitter" effect, above the missile sprite only
- Changes to fleet despawn logic: listeners will now be notified before the fleet member list is cleared
	- Allows seeing fleet state at time of despawn if it wasn't snapshotted
	- Fleet members removed afterwards
- Added CollisionGridAPI that gives access to internal bin-lattice used to speed up collision checks/AI
	- void addObject(Object object, Vector2f loc, float objWidth, float objHeight);
	- void removeObject(Object object, Vector2f loc, float objWidth, float objHeight);

	- CollisionGridAPI getMissileGrid();
	- CollisionGridAPI getAsteroidGrid();
- Added to SettingsAPI:
	- String readTextFileFromCommon(String filename)
	- void writeTextFileToCommon(String filename, String data)
	- Load/save text data from the <installdir>/saves/common/ folder
		- Limited to 1MB per file, 50MB total files per session
- Hull mods tagged with "no_drop_salvage" will not drop from campaign salvage operations
	- Different from "no_drop", which will only make them not drop from defeated ships in combat
- Added alternate system for listening to campaign events, see: ListenerManagerAPI
	- Allows registering to listen for only one type of event
	- Not everything converted to use it, but will only use this system going forward
- Added event-listening interfaces:
	- ShowLootListener
	- SurveyPlanetListener
	- EconomyTickListener
	- DiscoverEntityListener

	- See: Global.getSector().getIntelManager()
	- Replaces EventManager etc
	- CommMessageAPI, SectorAPI.reportEventStage, etc deprecated/removed

	- Missions are re-implemented as "IntelInfoPlugin" rather than a events
	- A few events that were essentially scripts (such as OfficerManagerEvent) remain for legacy reasons

	- All of these are now handled through IntelManager
	- Removed concept of "comm channels"; channels.json no longer loaded
- Added CombatEntityAPI.getAI() method to get at proximity fuse AI from projectiles
- Added ProximityFuseAIAPI, with an updateDamage() method, so changing damage via script can work on flak and similar
